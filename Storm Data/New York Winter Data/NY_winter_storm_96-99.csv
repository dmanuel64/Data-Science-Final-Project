This storm spread substantial amounts of Gulf moisture northward into central New York.  As this moisture encountered the cold air mass in place, a variety of wintery type precipitation again resulted.
     Snow began to fall over much of central New York during the late morning and early afternoon hours of the 8th.  The heaviest and steadiest snow fell from the Finger Lakes eastward across northern sections of the Susquehanna region and into the western Mohawk Valley.  A stripe of 4 to 7 inch amounts, which fell primarily during the afternoon and evening of the 8th, extended from Auburn and Seneca Falls in the Finger Lakes east to Sherburne, Cooperstown, Cortland, and Utica in the northern Susquehanna and Mohawk Valley regions.  Lesser amounts of 1 to 3 inches fell across the southern tier and Catskill areas.  
     As warmer air aloft moved over the region during the overnight hours from the 8th into the 9th, snow changed over to sleet, freezing rain, and even light rain for a time across the southern tier counties of New York.  Many areas received a thin glaze of ice on top of already fallen snow.  This created very hazardous travel conditions.  
     During the day on the 9th, as the main storm center pulled east into New England, colder air began to wrap back into central New York from the northwest.  The result was another burst of snow.  Additional accumulations of 3 to 6 inches were seen in many areas, especially the higher elevations and portions of Madison and Oneida counties.  Storm totals approached a foot in northern Oneida county in places like Forestport and Stokes Hill.

After midnight and lasting well into the morning on the 15th, precipitation intensity picked up once again.  Precipitation type was a mixed bag of sleet, freezing rain, and snow.  Primarily freezing rain and sleet fell across southern sections along the New York/Pennsylvania border and into the Catskills.  A coating of ice formed on top of already fallen snow in these areas, adding to the travel hazards and causing scattered power outages.  Further north through the Finger Lakes and Mohawk Valley areas, additional snow fell.  Icy precipitation did go back to snow for a period later in the morning on the 15th over the southern tier.
     Storm total snow accumulations generally ranged from 6 to 12 inches across central New York.  There appeared to be two narrow bands of heavier amounts.  One stretched from the central southern tier eastward to just north of Binghamton.  In this band, Avoca, Newark Valley, Berkshire, and the Binghamton Regional Airport all picked up 10 to 12 inches of snow.  Another axis of higher amounts stretched from the western Finger Lakes into Oneida county.  Here, the Syracuse Airport, Tully, and Forestport received 10 to 13 inches of fresh snow.

A consistent stream of moisture flowed northward during this time frame into a very cold arctic air mass in place over central New York.  The end result was heavy snowfall for most areas, as well as periods of sleet and freezing rain.
    Snow began falling late in the evening on the 13th in central New York, then continued through much of the day on the 14th.  Steady and heavy snow at times affected the region during the morning and early afternoon hours of the 14th.  Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour were observed on occasion, especially across New York's southern tier.  In addition, temperatures were unusually cold for such a significant snowfall in this part of the country.  Around daybreak on the 14th, temperatures were below zero in many areas.  As snow fell heavily during the day, readings only warmed up into the single digits.
     Snow tapered off to flurries, very light sleet, or freezing drizzle for a time during the late afternoon and evening of the 14th, mainly over the southern tier counties.

As a strong high pressure system moved east-southeast just north of Northern New England, a low pressure system developed southwest of the area.

A narrow band of light freezing rain changed to sleet and snow with the passage of an arctic cold front during Wednesday afternoon, January 13th. Northeast winds transported a cold shallow airmass that caused temperatures to fall from the 50s into the 20s within 6 hours of its' passage.

A 12 to 18 hour period of light snow preceded the developing storm as warmer air was forced above the cold arctic airmass.  Wind chills ranged from 15 to 25 degrees below 0 as northeast winds of 15 to 25 mph combined with temperatures in the teens along the coast and from 0 to 10 degrees above 0 inland.

As the low developed, warmer air was drawn into the system causing the snow to mix with sleet and freezing rain.  A prolonged period of freezing rain occurred from the NYC Metro Area north.  Significant icing caused widespread disruptions to mass transit and traffic.  Interstate 84 near Greenville Mountain in Middletown (Orange County) and Rte.22 in Bedford (N. Westchester County) were forced to close due to significant icing.  Ice also accumulated on trees and power lines and caused significant power outages in Orange and Putnam Counties.

Icing occurred in pockets across New York City and northern parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties.  Icing downed scattered tree limbs across this region.
