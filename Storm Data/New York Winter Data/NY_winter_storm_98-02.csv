A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet.  From mid-morning through late afternoon, light freezing rain fell along the coast with a mixture of freezing rain and sleet inland, except for just snow across Western Orange County.  As the low approached Long Island, bands of moderate to heavy precipitation rotated northwest around the low.  Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.  Bands of heavy snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City, and Western Nassau County during the evening.

Here are selected snowfall amounts from this storm for:

Manhattan:  from 5.5 inches at Central Park to 6 inches at Columbia University.

Bronx:  around 6 inches county-wide.

Staten Island:  around 6 inches at Richmond.

Brooklyn:  from 5.6 inches at Graves End to 6 inches at Bayridge.

Queens:  from 6 inches at LaGuardia Airport to 6.4 inches at JFK Airport.

A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet.  From mid-morning through late afternoon, light freezing rain fell along the coast with a mixture of freezing rain and sleet inland, except for just snow across Western Orange County.  As the low approached Long Island, bands of moderate to heavy precipitation rotated northwest around the low.  Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.  Bands of heavy snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City, and Western Nassau County during the evening.

Here are selected snowfall amounts from this storm for:

Manhattan:  from 5.5 inches at Central Park to 6 inches at Columbia University.

Bronx:  around 6 inches county-wide.

Staten Island:  around 6 inches at Richmond.

Brooklyn:  from 5.6 inches at Graves End to 6 inches at Bayridge.

Queens:  from 6 inches at LaGuardia Airport to 6.4 inches at JFK Airport.

Orange County:  from 8 inches at Gardinerville to 12 inches at both Port Jervis and Chester.

Rockland County:  6 inches was measured at Pomona.

Westchester County:  from 5.5 inches at Yorktown Heights to 8 inches at White Plains.

Nassau County:  from 5.3 inches at Valley Stream to 6.8 inches at Merrick.

Suffolk County:  from 3 inches at Islip Airport and Rocky Point to 7 inches at Huntington and Centerport (plus 1/4-inch thick ice).

A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet.  From mid-morning through late afternoon, light freezing rain fell along the coast with a mixture of freezing rain and sleet inland, except for just snow across Western Orange County.  As the low approached Long Island, bands of moderate to heavy precipitation rotated northwest around the low.  Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.  Bands of heavy snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City, and Western Nassau County during the evening.

With cold air in place, as a warm front approached from the south and a weak low pressure system moved northeast along the coast, light snow developed from around 6:40 am at Westchester County Airport to 10:45 am at Westhampton Beach (in Suffolk County).  Snowfall became heavy, falling at the rate of at least 1 inch per hour from around 10 am across the entire area until around 4 pm across Orange and Putnam Counties. Snow changed to freezing rain from around 2:30 pm along the south shore of Long Island to around 7 pm across Orange County.

Snowfall amounts ranged from 1 to 2 inches along the south shores of Long Island, 3 to 4 inches across the north shores of Long Island and New York City to 6 inches across the Lower Hudson Valley.  This first round of heavy precipitation was followed by up to a 1/8th-inch thick ice coating, which caused serious and widespread traffic disruptions.

Here are selected snowfall amounts:

For Orange County:  from 5.5 inches at Middletown, Walden, and Greenwood Lake to 6.5 inches at Montgomery.

For Putnam County:  from 3 inches at Lake Carmel to 6 inches at Croton Falls.

With cold air in place, as a warm front approached from the south and a weak low pressure system moved northeast along the coast, light snow developed from around 6:40 am at Westchester County Airport to 10:45 am at Westhampton Beach (in Suffolk County).  Snowfall became heavy, falling at the rate of at least 1 inch per hour from around 10 am across the entire area until around 4 pm across Orange and Putnam Counties. Snow changed to freezing rain from around 2:30 pm along the south shore of Long Island to around 7 pm across Orange County.

Snowfall amounts ranged from 1 to 2 inches along the south shores of Long Island, 3 to 4 inches across the north shores of Long Island and New York City to 6 inches across the Lower Hudson Valley.  This first round of heavy precipitation was followed by up to a 1/8th-inch thick ice coating, which caused serious and widespread traffic disruptions.

Here are selected snowfall amounts:

For Orange County:  from 5.5 inches at Middletown, Walden, and Greenwood Lake to 6.5 inches at Montgomery.

For Putnam County:  from 3 inches at Lake Carmel to 6 inches at Croton Falls.

For Westchester County:  from 2 inches at Yonkers to 6 inches at White Plains.

For New York (Manhattan) County:  from 3 inches at Central Park to 3.8 inches at Columbia University.

For Queens County:  from 2 inches at JFK Airport to 3 inches at LGA Airport.

Ample moisture was supplied  by the warm air mass over eastern New England. Enough cold air  was  both advected into the region as well as brought downward by heavy precipitation to change the rain over to snow, and produce an unusually late season snowstorm.

Snow, falling at the rate of 2 inches per hour, was common at the height of the storm. Gusty winds to near 35 mph produced near blizzard conditions at times, including both some blowing and drifting of the snow.  A mantle of 8 to locally more than 16 inches of snow buried the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys, Greater Capital District, Western Adirondacks as well as the Lake George Saratoga region.

Ample moisture was supplied  by the warm air mass over eastern New England. Enough cold air  was  both advected into the region as well as brought downward by heavy precipitation to change the rain over to snow, and produce an unusually late season snowstorm. The changeover was first noted  west  of  the Hudson Valley during the overnight hours of the 8th and 9th, then eventually east to the Taconics early on Sunday morning. Snow, falling at the rate of 2 inches per hour, was common at the height of the storm. Gusty winds to near 35 mph produced near blizzard conditions at times, including both some blowing and drifting of the snow.  A mantle of 8 to locally more than 16 inches of snow buried the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys, Greater Capital District, Western Adirondacks as well as the Lake George Saratoga region. Further south, 4  to 8 inches of snow covered portions of the Mid Hudson Valley. The official reading of 13.3 inches at Albany was the second heaviest April snowstorm on record, second only to a 17.7 inch storm during 1982.  Other specific readings included 15 inches at both Round Lake and Saratoga Springs, Saratoga county, 17 inches at Summit in Schoharie county, and 18 inches at Long Lake in Hamilton county. Over seven inches fell as far south as Poughkeepsie in Dutchess county.  
	Since the storm happened on a Sunday, disruptions from it were minimized. However, some business were closed or delayed in opening. The biggest damage from the storm was due to the heavy  wet nature of the snow, which resulted in many damaged or downed limbs and trees, especially  north  of the Mohawk River. Up to 35,000 customers in eastern New York were without  power during the height of the storm.",150

Low pressure developed along this front, off Cape Hatteras. This storm strengthened as it moved due north along the front during the early morning hours of the 9th.  Ample moisture was supplied  by the warm air mass over eastern New England. Enough cold air  was  both advected into the region as well as brought downward by heavy precipitation to change the rain over to snow, and produce an unusually late season snowstorm. The changeover was first noted  west  of  the Hudson Valley during the overnight hours of the 8th and 9th, then eventually east to the Taconics early on Sunday morning. Snow, falling at the rate of 2 inches per hour, was common at the height of the storm. Gusty winds to near 35 mph produced near blizzard conditions at times, including both some blowing and drifting of the snow.  A mantle of 8 to locally more than 16 inches of snow buried the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys, Greater Capital District, Western Adirondacks as well as the Lake George Saratoga region. Further south, 4  to 8 inches of snow covered portions of the Mid Hudson Valley. The official reading of 13.3 inches at Albany was the second heaviest April snowstorm on record, second only to a 17.7 inch storm during 1982.  Other specific readings included 15 inches at both Round Lake and Saratoga Springs, Saratoga county, 17 inches at Summit in Schoharie county, and 18 inches at Long Lake in Hamilton county. Over seven inches fell as far south as Poughkeepsie in Dutchess county.  
	Since the storm happened on a Sunday, disruptions from it were minimized. However, some business were closed or delayed in opening. The biggest damage from the storm was due to the heavy  wet nature of the snow, which resulted in many damaged or downed limbs and trees, especially  north  of the Mohawk River.

Snowfall began between 5 and 7 AM across the area, and fell at intense rates right from the start. Snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. There were also numerous reports of thunder and lightning accompanying the most intense snow bands. Winds also began to increase later Saturday morning, causing some blowing and drifting of snow, which reduced visibilities significantly, and created near blizzard conditions at times in some areas.

A low pressure system developed off the mid Atlantic coast Saturday afternoon and moved northeast, passing east of Long Island early Sunday.  With abundant low level moisture and cold air in place, light intermittent precipitation occurred Saturday.  As the low intensified, heavy precipitation developed and moved northeast across the area. 

Heavy snow occurred across Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and northern Westchester counties. 

In the New York City area, southern Westchester County, and across Nassau County, a period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, producing ice accumulations of up to 0.20 inches.  This buildup of ice on major highways and bridges produced hazardous travel conditions Saturday night, and contributed to an airplane skidding off the runway at JFK Airport Sunday morning. The sleet and freezing rain changed to heavy snow early Sunday morning.

A low pressure system developed off the mid Atlantic coast Saturday afternoon and moved northeast, passing east of Long Island early Sunday.  With abundant low level moisture and cold air in place, light intermittent precipitation occurred Saturday.  As the low intensified, heavy precipitation developed and moved northeast across the area. 

Heavy snow occurred across Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and northern Westchester counties. 

In the New York City area, southern Westchester County, and across Nassau County, a period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, producing ice accumulations of up to 0.20 inches.  This buildup of ice on major highways and bridges produced hazardous travel conditions Saturday night, and contributed to an airplane skidding off the runway at JFK Airport Sunday morning. The sleet and freezing rain changed to heavy snow early Sunday morning. 
 
Across Suffolk County, a significant period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, before changing to heavy snow early Sunday morning.  Ice accumulations ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 inches.  This accretion of ice on tree limbs caused some tree branches to fall, and led to power outages. 

Here are some specific snowfall and ice amounts for:

Orange County:  from 5 inches at Newburgh to 7 inches measured at Chester.

Putnam County:  8.1 inches measured at Fahnestock State Park.

Rockland County:  6 inches measured at Pomona.

Westchester County:  from 5 inches at Yorktown Heights to 7.3 inches measured at White Plains.

New York City:

A complex and slow-moving coastal storm affected much of southeast New York and Long Island from Sunday March 4th through the early morning hours of Wednesday March 7th. This storm was accompanied by a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain through the early portion of the event, and mainly heavy snow for the remainder of the event. Gusty winds and minor to moderate coastal flooding and beach erosion also occurred along coastal portions of Long Island.

On Sunday March 4th, a strong low pressure system moved east across the Tennessee Valley, while a new low slowly developed off the Mid Atlantic coast. The precipitation shield accompanying this complex storm system moved north and reached southeast New York in the form of spotty light snow and sleet by Sunday afternoon. The precipitation intensified Sunday night and early Monday, but as warmer air moved into the region aloft, the snow changed to a mixture of sleet, freezing rain and rain by Monday morning along coastal sections. Some portions of interior southeast New York received several inches of snow from this initial surge of precipitation.

During Monday March 5th, the new low pressure system off the Mid Atlantic coast began to intensify rapidly. This spread heavy precipitation across eastern Long Island from the east by Monday afternoon and evening. As colder air was drawn into the storm's circulation, the precipitation changed to heavy wet snow by Monday evening across eastern Long Island. Snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour for at least 3 hours were common across most of Suffolk County through the early portion of Monday night. This heavier snow also began to move west, spreading across western Long Island and the New York City area later Monday night into Tuesday.

Bands of moderate to heavy wet snow continued into Tuesday across much of southeast New York, extending back into interior sections as the low slowly drifted north off the eastern end of Long Island. This coastal low then became nearly stationary during Tuesday, and even retrograded slightly to the southwest during Tuesday afternoon. This prolonged the  periods of moderate to heavy wet snow across most of southeast New York into the late afternoon hours on Tuesday. The storm finally began to retreat east off the New Jersey coast Tuesday night and Wednesday, allowing the snow to taper off and end by early Wednesday morning on March 7th.

The combination of very heavy wet snow and strong winds with this prolonged coastal storm produced scattered power outages across southeast New York, primarily across Suffolk County. In addition, many schools and businesses were closed for several days due to the hazardous nature of this storm. 

Here are some storm total snowfall amounts:

For Orange County: 6 inches at Middletown, to 13 inches at Monroe and Tuxedo Park.

For Putnam County: 6 inches at Carmel, to 14 inches at Mahopac.

For Rockland County: 4.5 inches at Valley Cottage, to 7.6 inches at Stony Point.

For Westchester County: 5.5 inches at New Rochelle, to 9.5 inches at Yonkers.

For New York County (Manhattan): 3.5 inches at Central Park, to 6 inches at Columbia University.

For Bronx County: 4 inches to 6.7 inches.

For Kings County (Brooklyn): 2.5 inches at Bay Ridge, to 4.2 inches at Gravesend.

For Richmond County (Staten Island): 3 inches at New Dorp, to 3.8 inches at Grasmere.

For Queens County: 3.7 inches at John F. Kennedy International Airport, to 6.0 inches at La Guardia Airport.

For Nassau County: 4 inches at Sea Cliff, to 7.4 inches at Hicksville.

For Suffolk County: 5.6 inches at Montauk Point, to 16.0 inches at East Setauket and Huntington.",263

A complex and slow-moving coastal storm affected much of southeast New York and Long Island from Sunday March 4th through the early morning hours of Wednesday March 7th. This storm was accompanied by a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain through the early portion of the event, and mainly heavy snow for the remainder of the event. Gusty winds and minor to moderate coastal flooding and beach erosion also occurred along coastal portions of Long Island.

On Sunday March 4th, a strong low pressure system moved east across the Tennessee Valley, while a new low slowly developed off the Mid Atlantic coast. The precipitation shield accompanying this complex storm system moved north and reached southeast New York in the form of spotty light snow and sleet by Sunday afternoon. The precipitation intensified Sunday night and early Monday, but as warmer air moved into the region aloft, the snow changed to a mixture of sleet, freezing rain and rain by Monday morning along coastal sections. Some portions of interior southeast New York received several inches of snow from this initial surge of precipitation.

During Monday March 5th, the new low pressure system off the Mid Atlantic coast began to intensify rapidly. This spread heavy precipitation across eastern Long Island from the east by Monday afternoon and evening. As colder air was drawn into the storm's circulation, the precipitation changed to heavy wet snow by Monday evening across eastern Long Island. Snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour for at least 3 hours were common across most of Suffolk County through the early portion of Monday night. This heavier snow also began to move west, spreading across western Long Island and the New York City area later Monday night into Tuesday.

Bands of moderate to heavy wet snow continued into Tuesday across much of southeast New York, extending back into interior sections as the low slowly drifted north off the eastern end of Long Island. This coastal low then became nearly stationary during Tuesday, and even retrograded slightly to the southwest during Tuesday afternoon. This prolonged the  periods of moderate to heavy wet snow across most of southeast New York into the late afternoon hours on Tuesday. The storm finally began to retreat east off the New Jersey coast Tuesday night and Wednesday, allowing the snow to taper off and end by early Wednesday morning on March 7th.

The combination of very heavy wet snow and strong winds with this prolonged coastal storm produced scattered power outages across southeast New York, primarily across Suffolk County. In addition, many schools and businesses were closed for several days due to the hazardous nature of this storm. 

Here are some storm total snowfall amounts:

For Orange County: 6 inches at Middletown, to 13 inches at Monroe and Tuxedo Park.

For Putnam County: 6 inches at Carmel, to 14 inches at Mahopac.

For Rockland County: 4.5 inches at Valley Cottage, to 7.6 inches at Stony Point.

A complex and slow-moving coastal storm affected much of southeast New York and Long Island from Sunday March 4th through the early morning hours of Wednesday March 7th. This storm was accompanied by a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain through the early portion of the event, and mainly heavy snow for the remainder of the event. Gusty winds and minor to moderate coastal flooding and beach erosion also occurred along coastal portions of Long Island.

On Sunday March 4th, a strong low pressure system moved east across the Tennessee Valley, while a new low slowly developed off the Mid Atlantic coast. The precipitation shield accompanying this complex storm system moved north and reached southeast New York in the form of spotty light snow and sleet by Sunday afternoon. The precipitation intensified Sunday night and early Monday, but as warmer air moved into the region aloft, the snow changed to a mixture of sleet, freezing rain and rain by Monday morning along coastal sections. Some portions of interior southeast New York received several inches of snow from this initial surge of precipitation.

During Monday March 5th, the new low pressure system off the Mid Atlantic coast began to intensify rapidly. This spread heavy precipitation across eastern Long Island from the east by Monday afternoon and evening. As colder air was drawn into the storm's circulation, the precipitation changed to heavy wet snow by Monday evening across eastern Long Island. Snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour for at least 3 hours were common across most of Suffolk County through the early portion of Monday night. This heavier snow also began to move west, spreading across western Long Island and the New York City area later Monday night into Tuesday.

Bands of moderate to heavy wet snow continued into Tuesday across much of southeast New York, extending back into interior sections as the low slowly drifted north off the eastern end of Long Island. This coastal low then became nearly stationary during Tuesday, and even retrograded slightly to the southwest during Tuesday afternoon. This prolonged the  periods of moderate to heavy wet snow across most of southeast New York into the late afternoon hours on Tuesday. The storm finally began to retreat east off the New Jersey coast Tuesday night and Wednesday, allowing the snow to taper off and end by early Wednesday morning on March 7th.

The combination of very heavy wet snow and strong winds with this prolonged coastal storm produced scattered power outages across southeast New York, primarily across Suffolk County. In addition, many schools and businesses were closed for several days due to the hazardous nature of this storm. 

Here are some storm total snowfall amounts:

For Orange County: 6 inches at Middletown, to 13 inches at Monroe and Tuxedo Park.

For Putnam County: 6 inches at Carmel, to 14 inches at Mahopac.

For Rockland County: 4.5 inches at Valley Cottage, to 7.6 inches at Stony Point.

For Westchester County: 5.5 inches at New Rochelle, to 9.5 inches at Yonkers.

For Kings County (Brooklyn): 2.5 inches at Bay Ridge, to 4.2 inches at Gravesend.
