Once there, the storm intensified rapidly as it only gradually moved further offshore.  The combination of cold air in place, a deep easterly flow of Atlantic moisture, and intense upper level energy produced widespread heavy snow across central New York.
     Snow began falling just after midnight on the 24th.  It quickly became heavy as it persisted through the day, not tapering off until early in the morning on the 25th.   A relatively narrow band of very heavy snow set up during the morning of the 24th from sections of the Mohawk Valley southward across Chenango and eastern Broome counties.  By the time the storm wound down, snowfall tallies of 20 to 30 inches were common in this corridor.  The highest official total was 30 inches in Conklin Forks in southern Broome county.  Several reports of near 30 inch totals were also received from higher elevation sections of Chenango county.  The heavy wet nature of the snow also brought down numerous power lines that resulted in widespread outages.  In some more isolated locations, power was not restored for 3 to 4 days.
     Across much of the remainder of central New York, 10 to 20 inch amounts were common.  From valley sections of Sullivan county into southern Delaware county, somewhat lesser amounts of 4 to 12 inches were recorded.  Several hours of sleet and freezing rain mixed in across these locations, helping to keep snowfall accumulations down.  The higher elevations in this region saw amounts approaching a foot.  This included such places as Dale Mountain in Sullivan county and Stamford in Delaware county.",,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once the low pressure system moved off the New Jersey coast, it began to slow down and throw Atlantic moisture back over sections of the Catskills, also producing a burst of snow across this region.  
     During daylight hours on the 15th and into the very early morning hours of the 16th, the combination of additional upper level energy and multi-band development off Lake Ontario produced several more inches of snow for many parts of central New York and locally heavy amounts in Oneida county.

Some specific totals included 11 inches in Westernville and Forestport, and 9 inches in Point Rock.  For many other parts of central New York, amounts averaged 5 to 8 inches.

By that afternoon, the combination of this cold air crossing over the still relatively warm Lake Ontario waters set off bands of lake effect snow.
     The most intense band of snow became positioned over northern Oneida county from late in the afternoon on the 22nd into the early morning hours of the 23rd.  The band occasionally migrated into central portions of the county during the overnight period.  By mid-morning on the 23rd, this lake snow band had shifted back northward into far northern sections of the county, then eventually out of the area into Lewis and Jefferson counties.

The system then redeveloped near Long Island early on the 7th and moved slowly through central New England thereafter.  Two distinct bouts of heavy snowfall affected central New York during this time frame.  The initial shot of snow fell primarily during the day on Saturday the 6th.  After a lull that evening, snowfall picked up again overnight and continued into the morning hours of the 7th before tapering off.
     On the 6th, snow first developed just prior to daybreak across the Finger Lakes and central southern tier regions.  The snow quickly spread eastward to envelope all of central New York by mid-morning.  Late in the afternoon, the first shot of snow moved off to the east.  Accumulations over central New York during the day generally ranged from 5 to 12 inches.  The heaviest band of snow extended west to east from the northern Finger Lakes all the way through the northern Susquehanna and Mohawk Valley regions.  Some specific totals were as follows: 13 inches in Stokes Hills in Oneida county, 11 inches in Laurens in Otsego county, and generally from 8 to 10 inches in northern Steuben, Yates, Cortland, Chenango, and Madison counties.
     During the overnight hours from the 6th into the 7th, the brief respite from snowfall ended as heavier precipitation once again formed across central New York.  By the time the snow wound down by late morning on the 7th, an additional 5 to 10 inches had fallen over many portions of the region, primarily to the north and northeast of Binghamton and Elmira.  Storm totals from the two day event approached two feet in portions of northern Oneida county, and reached well over a foot throughout much of the Finger Lakes, northern Susquehanna, and Mohawk Valley regions.",343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With cold air in place,  a low pressure system developed over the Gulf Coast States on Saturday, March 13th.  As the low slowly intensified and moved northeast toward the Mid-Atlantic Coast, it spread precipitation northeast across the area.  Light rain quickly changed to wet snow during the afternoon of March 14th.  The wet snow became heavy overnight as the low approached the Mid-Atlantic States.  Snowfall amounts generally ranged from 6 to 11 inches across the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island.  Heavy wet snow downed many tree limbs and power lines across the region.
