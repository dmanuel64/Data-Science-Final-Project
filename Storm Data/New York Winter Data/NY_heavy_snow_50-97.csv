Significant Atlantic moisture was thrown back inland over portions of central New York.  This moisture combined with colder air moving south into the region to bring heavy snow.
     Rain changed to snow early in the morning of the 31st.  Snow quickly became heavy by mid to late morning.  Blinding, heavy wet snow belted the western Catskills of New York from midday on the 31st into the early morning hours of April 1st.  The wet nature of the snow and strong accompanying winds brought down many trees and caused widespread power outages, especially across the higher terrain.  State police and emergency management officials reported that hundreds of motorists had to be rescued and placed in Red Cross shelters or other accomodations on the night of the 31st.  Most roadways through the Catskills became impassable and were closed by late in the day on the 31st.  States of emergency were declared in Sullivan and Delaware counties.  
     By the time snow finally began to wind down after midnight on April 1st, a general 12 to 30 inches had fallen from the Catskills northward into the Mohawk valley.  Claryville in Sullivan county picked up about 24 inches of snow while the higher elevations of Delaware county had a widespread 15 to 20 inch snowfall.  Significant 6 to 12 inch accumulations extended as far back westward as hilltop sections of Cortland, Broome, and Chenango counties.",,354
