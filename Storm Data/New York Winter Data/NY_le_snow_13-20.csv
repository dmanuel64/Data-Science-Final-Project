There were 13 fatalities with this storm, hundreds of major roof collapses and structural failures, 1000s of stranded motorists, and scattered food and gas shortages due to impassable roads.  Numerous trees also gave way due to the weight of the snow, causing isolated power outages.  While this storm was impressive on its own, a second lake effect event on Nov-19-20 dropped another 1-4 feet of snow over nearly the same area and compounded rescue and recovery efforts.  |The storm began Monday around 6 PM (Nov 17) as a band of snow developed over the Buffalo Southtowns and quickly moved into the Northtowns with thunder and lightning.  The band settled south fairly quickly and by 9PM the band had moved mostly just south of the city and airport and locked in place as the 15 to 20 mile wide band centered on a line from Lackawanna and Hamburg across West Seneca, Lancaster, and Alden.  The northern edge of the lake effect band was so striking that many described it as a wall of snow.  Snow rates on the northern edge easily exceeded 3 inches per hour with some snow rates near 6 inches per hour.  By sunrise some areas had already exceeded 3 feet of snow.  Meanwhile, the southern edge of the band was located along the Lake Erie shoreline in Chautauqua County to near the Southtowns, including Orchard Park, East Aurora, and east into Wyoming County including Attica where about a foot of snow had fallen by sunrise.  Travel across the Southtowns was nearly impossible with most roads unplowed as plows, at least those that weren���t stuck, focused a few main roadways needed for emergency vehicles.  The Thruway was shut down from the Pennsylvania border to Rochester, and other routes, including I-190, I-290, and Route 400 were also shutdown. |During Tuesday November 18, the snow band didn���t budge, and by nightfall snow amounts from Lancaster to Southern Cheektowaga east to Alden had accumulated in excess of 4 to 5 feet. The wall of snow was still quite apparent with blue skies to the north and zero visibility on the other side.  On Transit Road, there were only a few inches on the ground at Genesee Street, but several feet of snow at Walden Avenue less than 2 miles to the south. Winds gusted to 35 mph but in general winds created sub-blizzard conditions.  There were still whiteout conditions however as snow continued to fall in excess of 3 inches per hour.

Finally, the band let up as it drifted to the north and weakened rapidly Wednesday morning.  |Millions of dollars were lost as dairy farmers were forced to dump milk that could not be transported for processing.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario.

This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County.

By Christmas evening, a very robust single plume had developed with localized reports of 5 to 6 inches per hour at Perrysburg in Cattaraugus County and in southern Erie County, along with a few cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. There was considerable blowing and drifting ongoing at the time. Strong wind gusts and blowing snow also accompanied this early part of the event, with gusts 35 to 45 mph.  The westerly flow then became locked in from late on the 25th to the 27th, with a lake shore hugging band near Erie, PA that spread inland across Mayville to Perrysburg to Springville to Arcade where it lingered for nearly 2 days.

The snow storm tapered off late in the day on Wednesday the 27th as the flow broke the lake effect into narrow, disorganized multibands. By the evening the snow tapered off completely as high pressure and drier air moved into the lower Great Lakes.
