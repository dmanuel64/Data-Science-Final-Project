Model guidance waffled all over with the track of this system in the days before its arrival, eventually placing the low on a more southerly track. This resulted in widespread snow across the area rather than a mix, and it also yielded an extended period of west-northwesterly flow lake effect snow in its wake. Because of a lack of cold air outbreaks during the course of the winter, both Lake Erie and Ontario were nearly ice free, resulting in heavy snow squalls with very gusty conditions across the Southern Tier and Tug Hill regions. Widespread accumulations of 2-3 feet occurred east of Lake Ontario with 1-2 feet common east of Lake Erie. Selected specific snow accumulations include 8.9 inches in Lockport, 31.2 inches in Redfield, 48 inches in Carthage, 28.5 inches in Copenhagen, 14.5 inches in Warsaw, 12.5 inches in Jamestown, 20.3 inches in Perrysburg, and 25 inches in Springville. Selected wind gusts included measured gusts of 62 mph at Fredonia, 60 mph at Oswego, 60 mph at Watertown, and 56 mph at Hamburg.||In addition to snow and wind, lakeshore flooding with the passage of the system became a problem on Lake Erie.
