With a cold and dry airmass in place, the snow was initially light in intensity and little accumulation occurred during the day.  ||However, as the secondary low began to rapidly develop, a steadier and heavier snowfall moved across the region during the evening hours and into the overnight.  Snow fell at rates in excess of one inch per hour over much of the region and snow rates locally were as high as up to three inches per hour at times.  During the overnight hours, sleet and freezing rain mixed in with the snow across portions of the mid-Hudson Valley and Taconics, but the precipitation remained all in the form of snow north and west of there. ||The bulk of the accumulating snow was finished by the late overnight hours, but light snow showers and flurries continued into the mid-morning hours, especially across the Adirondacks and Capital Region.  By the end of the storm, many places around the eastern Catskills, Capital Region and Lake George Saratoga Region received around a foot of snowfall. Lighter snowfall of 5 to 8 inches occured in the mid-Hudson Valley due to the mixing with sleet and freezing rain. Lighter snowfall amounts of 6 to 9 inches occurred in the western Adirondacks and western Mohawk Valley, as the heaviest snow remained east of these locations.",273

This area of low pressure was responsible for a significant snow and ice event across the Gulf Coast and Southeast states.  Well ahead of the storm system, a heavy band of snowfall moved from south to north across the region.  The snow began in the morning hours and continued in the early to mid-afternoon hours.  Snow fell at rates of up to three inches per hour, causing significant travel issues across the region.||Much of the region experienced a break in the steady snowfall between the late afternoon and early evening hours as the initial band of precipitation shifted north and east of the region and only periods of lighter snowfall occurred.  However, the strengthening coastal storm allowed a second round of steady, heavy precipitation to begin in the late evening hours.  This snowfall moved from south to north across the region for the overnight hours.  Once again, the snow fell at significant rates of up to three inches per hour.  Some sleet and freezing rain mixed in with the snow across the mid-Hudson Valley and Taconics region during the late evening hours.  In addition, lightning and thunder accompanied the snow across far southern and eastern areas at times as well.||The snow tapered off from west to east during the morning hours after sunrise on February 14th, as the storm moved northeast towards eastern New England and Atlantic Canada. By the time snow ended, between one and two feet of snow fell across much of the Lake George Saratoga Region, Capital Region, Schoharie Valley, eastern Catskills, Taconics, and mid-Hudson Valley.
