On Tuesday, December 24th, an area of low pressure began to develop over the Gulf coast states.  That night, the storm intensified as it moved northeast, reaching the Virginia coastline by daybreak on December 25th.  Around this time, spotty drizzle and light rain began to overspread the New York Metropolitan area and Long Island, while light freezing rain and freezing drizzle started to fall across the lower Hudson Valley.  As the morning progressed, the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast.  As a result, a steady rain developed over New York City and Long Island, while freezing rain began to mix with sleet and snow in the lower Hudson Valley.  As the storm started to move east of the tri-state area, winds shifted from the east and northeast to the north or northwest. This allowed colder air to slowly infiltrate southeastern New York.  The wintry mix changed to snow in the lower Hudson Valley during the early afternoon, and the rain changed to snow during the mid afternoon in New York City and during the late afternoon across all of Long Island except for the twin forks region where the rain did not change to snow until that evening.  During the late afternoon and early evening, narrow bands of heavy snow developed and moved over parts of the region, which resulted in large ranges of snowfall with this storm.  As the center of the storm continued to move northeast away from the area, the snow then tapered off to light snow and flurries overnight, ending shortly after midnight in the lower Hudson Valley and New York City, and from west to east between about 2 am and 4 am across Long Island.  Snowfall amounts in Orange and Putnam counties ranged from 10 to 20 inches, 6 to 12 inches fell in Rockland and Westchester counties, and 3 to 6 inches in New York City, except for an area across the eastern Bronx and northeastern Queens, where 6 to 10 inches fell.  On Long Island, 6 to 12 inches fell in Nassau and Western Suffolk counties, while across eastern Suffolk amounts ranged from less than an inch across the twin forks to 2 to 4 inches just west of Riverhead. The wide ranges of snowfall were generally due to narrow banding of heavy snow, but across Long Island the timing of the change from rain to snow also accounted for the pronounced differential of snow received.",182

On Tuesday, December 24th, an area of low pressure began to develop over the Gulf coast states.  That night, the storm intensified as it moved northeast, reaching the Virginia coastline by daybreak on December 25th.  Around this time, spotty drizzle and light rain began to overspread the New York Metropolitan area and Long Island, while light freezing rain and freezing drizzle started to fall across the lower Hudson Valley.  As the morning progressed, the center of low pressure started to track northeast over the Atlantic along a path that hugged the coast.  As a result, a steady rain developed over New York City and Long Island, while freezing rain began to mix with sleet and snow in the lower Hudson Valley.

With an exceptionally strong high pressure system over New England, a low pressure system developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast.  Periods of light snow developed as northeast winds increased to around 15 mph across the NYC Metro area Sunday afternoon, February 16th.  Snow became widespread and heavy, falling at rates up to 2 to 3 inches per hour Sunday night and Monday, February 17th.  Heavy snow blown by northeast winds 20 to 30 mph caused near blizzard conditions throughout the area.  Record heavy snowfalls crippled mass transit.  These extremely hazardous weather conditions led to local emergency declarations throughout the region.

With an exceptionally strong high pressure system over New England, a low pressure system developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast.  Periods of light snow developed as northeast winds increased to around 15 mph across the NYC Metro area Sunday afternoon, February 16th.  Snow became widespread and heavy, falling at rates up to 2 to 3 inches per hour Sunday night and Monday, February 17th.  Heavy snow blown by northeast winds 20 to 30 mph caused near blizzard conditions throughout the area.  Record heavy snowfalls crippled mass transit.  These extremely hazardous weather conditions led to local emergency declarations throughout the region.  In New York City, the cost estimate for total snowfall operations was around 20 million dollars.  In addition, widespread moderate beach erosion and minor tidal flooding accompanied this system.

Storm Total Snowfall ranged from around 14 to 28 inches.

A weak low pressure system formed over the Ohio River Valley along a pre-existing and nearly stationary frontal boundary on Wednesday, March 5th. That night this storm started to move east, and passed just south of the New York City Metropolitan area and Long Island on Thursday, March 6th. Meanwhile, an area of strengthening High Pressure started to build down from southern Canada. This created a north to northeast flow, which allowed rain and sleet at the onset of precipitation to quickly turn to snow, which remained the precipitation type for the duration of the storm. Snowfall amounts for this late winter storm were as follows:

Orange County: 7 to 10 inches, including 7.0 inches at Newburgh and 8.0 inches in Monroe.

Putnam County: 5 to 7 inches, including 6.5 inches in Brewster.

Rockland County: 5 to 7 inches.

A weak low pressure system formed over the Ohio River Valley along a pre-existing and nearly stationary frontal boundary on Wednesday, March 5th. That night this storm started to move east, and passed just south of the New York City Metropolitan area and Long Island on Thursday, March 6th.
