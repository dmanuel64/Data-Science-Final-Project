The clash between air masses and abundant moisture accounted for a heavy precipitation event across northern New York.||The close proximity to the deeper, arctic air across Ontario province accounted for a snow mixed with sleet at the onset on the night of the 7th that changed to mainly snow on the 8th across the St. Lawrence River Valley. Meanwhile, rain overspread the Champlain Valley during the evening of March 7th with scattered areas of freezing rain and sleet along the Canadian border. On March 8th, colder air filtered into the Champlain Valley near the surface, which changed precipitation to a prolonged period of heavy freezing rain and sleet that ended during the evening.||Sleet and freezing rain caused havoc across the Champlain Valley of New York with an inch or more of sleet as well as an half inch or more of ice accumulation from freezing rain. While, heavy snow and sleet accumulation in the Adirondacks and St. Lawrence River Valley caused equal amounts of problems.||Numerous vehicle accidents, downed tree limbs, power lines and power outages impacted portions of northern New York.",332
