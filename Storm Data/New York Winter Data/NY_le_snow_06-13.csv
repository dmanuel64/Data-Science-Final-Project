Lake Effect rain began Thursday (10/13/06) morning. By midday the rain began mixing with graupel and thunder and lightning was reported. The cold air became deep enough to change the precipitation to wet snow across the Niagara Frontier by 2 p.m. Little accumulation resulted for the first few hours of snowfall. By between 5 and 8 p.m. accumulations began to reach the two to three inch mark. The weight of this heavy, wet snow on nearly fully-leafed trees began to weigh down and snap the trees. Conditions only worsened overnight with near constant thunder and lightning for nearly 12 hours.|     The heaviest snowband set up across the northern suburbs of Buffalo in Erie County Thursday evening, then drifted south to the southern suburbs around midnight. The band of snow then lifted slightly reaching the City of Buffalo city and eastern suburbs in the wee hours before lifting north across the northern suburbs again around daybreak and eventually to Niagara county Friday morning where it weakened and changed back to rain. |     Even though plenty of damage resulted already in the first few inches, total snowfall in this event was incredible. Five to eight inches fell in the first phase of the event between 3 p.m. and Midnight, but the snow-to-water ratio was around 6:1, hence the terrific damage to trees and powerlines. The second phase featured slightly drier snow, snow-to-water ratio closer to 12:1 but it piled up another foot in heaviest area in just 4 hours or so.  |     The 22.6 inches recorded at the Buffalo Airport by far exceeded any October record (6��� in 1909���only 4 falls of 2��� or more in 100 yrs in October), but was the 6th greatest snowfall ever at any time in Buffalo!|     The crippling snows extended well east across Genesee and Orleans counties and into western Monroe county. Scattered power outages and downed trees were reported in Brockport where three inches of the heavy, wet snow fell. To the north, the snows pushed into Niagara County with a sharp cutoff to any damage along a line from Wheatfield to Medina.  To the south, the cutoff ran along a line from Hamburg to East Aurora. |     Governor Pataki declared a State Disaster Emergency in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties on Friday October 13.  President Bush declared the four counties eligible for disaster assistance on October 24. (FEMA-1655-DR). By the beginning of December 2006, nearly $11 million in disaster grants and low-interest disaster loans were been approved. |     Over 400,000 National Grid and New York State Electric and Gas (NYSEG) customers lost power Thursday evening. Full restoration of power was not completed until 13 days after the storm with most regions being without power for about 5 days. Most area schools were closed for the entire week following the storm.|     One death was directly attributed to the storm. In Amherst, a man was clearing snow in his driveway when a tree limb broke off, fell and crushed him. Fourteen other deaths were indirectly storm-related. This number includes four people who died from carbon monoxide poisoning from the improper use of generators and kerosene heaters.  Over two hundred were treated for exposure to carbon monoxide. Seventeen were treated for hypothermia.  |     The seasonal timing and pre-conditions of the event only exacerbated the impacts. Only a couple inches of the heavy snow was needed to bring down the still fully leafed trees. In addition, the area had experienced a wet pattern prior to the storm. The wet ground made it easier for tree root systems to fail. Estimates to remove the debris from the storm is pegged at over $150 million. Over three million cubic yards of debris needed to be cleaned up.|    Local and State Departments of Transportation were not prepared for such an early storm. Most were still in paving mode and had not prepared their equipment to plow snow.  The heavy snow also made driving even more difficult. About a hundred mile stretch of the Thruway was closed. Hundreds of motorists were stranded between Pembroke and Angola. Some of these people were stranded for twelve to eighteen hours.  Other transportation issues included motorists not being prepared for winter driving and tractor trailers not using the proper fuel mix for the wintry weather. Most areas initiated driving bans and declared States of Emergency early in the onset of the storm.|     Daytime temperatures slowly moderated through the next week���around 50 on the 13th, 14th, and 15th then into the upper 50s to near 60 on the 16th and 17th.  Overnight lows dipped back into the low to mid 30s.  These conditions allowed for a slow snowmelt with relatively few flood issues. Any flood problems that did occur were primarily the result of trees and limbs blocking the normal flow channel.|      Specific snow total reports received included:  Depew, Lancaster and Alden - 24 inches; Buffalo Airport - 22.6 inches; Buffalo (north) - 20 inches, Buffalo (downtown) - 15 inches, Buffalo (south) - 10 inches;  Amherst - 14 to 22 inches; Clarence - 16 to 22 inches; Tonawanda - 12 to 18 inches; West Seneca - 14 inches; No. Tonawanda - 6 to 12 inches; Hamburg - 8 to 14 inches; Orchard Park - 8 inches; Batavia -10 inches; Medina - 8 inches; Lockport - 6 to 8 inches; Grand Island (south) - 10 inches; Grand Island (north) 2 inches; Albion - 5 inches; and Brockport -3 inches.",1

The wet ground made it easier for tree root systems to fail. Estimates to remove the debris from the storm is pegged at over $150 million. Over three million cubic yards of debris needed to be cleaned up.|    Local and State Departments of Transportation were not prepared for such an early storm. Most were still in paving mode and had not prepared their equipment to plow snow.  The heavy snow also made driving even more difficult. About a hundred mile stretch of the Thruway was closed. Hundreds of motorists were stranded between Pembroke and Angola. Some of these people were stranded for twelve to eighteen hours.  Other transportation issues included motorists not being prepared for winter driving and tractor trailers not using the proper fuel mix for the wintry weather. Most areas initiated driving bans and declared States of Emergency early in the onset of the storm.|     Daytime temperatures slowly moderated through the next week���around 50 on the 13th, 14th, and 15th then into the upper 50s to near 60 on the 16th and 17th.

It will be remembered not only for its intense and deep snowfalls, but for the incredibly tight snowfall gradient on the northern edge across the most densely populated region of metro Buffalo, attesting to its remarkable steady state, moving less than 3 miles during a 30 hour period. This allowed snowfall rates of 1-2 inches per hour to fall over the exact same area. The event evolved quickly as a major synoptic storm departed the area. Temperatures on the 1st started the day in the 50s but fell rapidly. A lake plume developed off Lake Erie by early afternoon on a southwest flow and intensified by 3 pm as it rolled into the Buffalo South Towns. The band then lifted north a bit during the early evening and remained pretty much locked in place for the next 30 hours or so. There was the typical thunder and lightning often seen during early season events. The wind fields finally weakened with increasing shear as a surface ridge built in by Friday morning the 3rd, disrupting and dissipating the band.|Snowfall amounts were incredible within the band. A general 30 to 40 inches fell in about a five mile strip which ran from Lackawanna and southeast Buffalo, east northeast across northern West Seneca, south Cheektowaga, Depew and Lancaster over to Alden. Amounts dropped off steadily to the south, with about a foot in Orchard Park and less further south. The real story was the northern gradient though. Amounts dropped from two feet to a dusting in just a 3 or 4 mile distance! This was evident along north-south roads like Transit and Harlem. For example, no measurable snow fell at Main and Harlem, but two feet at Walden and Harlem. The Buffalo Airport was right at the cutoff, with 2 inches at its northwest corner and a foot at its southeast corner! Further west, no snow fell in Buffalo at North Street; four inches at fell City Hall and a foot fell near HSBC arena. |This event had major impact, not only in the 300,000 or so people affected, but from a major backup and shut down of the NYS Thruway from Exit 52 to 54, with hundreds stranded for almost 24 hours. |Reported snow totals:  42��� Depew; 30��� Elma, Lancaster and West Seneca; 23��� Marilla; 17��� Darien; 16��� Wales; 14��� Akron; 11��� East Aurora and Warsaw; and Buffalo trace across North Buffalo to 39��� across the southeast corner of the city.|Activity off Lake Ontario, usually fairly similar to Erie, did not materialize nearly as well this time.

As this cold air crossed over the water of Lake Ontario, a broken band of lake effect snow developed during the evening of Tuesday, March 19th. ||This snow moved across the Tughill Plateau and into the western Adirondacks from the evening of Tuesday, March 19th into the early morning hours of Wednesday, March 20th.  The band of snow continued through the day on Wednesday, March 20th, although the band became less intense and oscillated across the region at times.  The lake effect snow reorganized during the evening of the 20th into the early morning hours of Thursday, March 21st. ||The lake effect snow began to finally break up just prior to sunrise on Thursday, March 21st as the flow shifted due to an approaching upper level shortwave trough.  By that time, lake effect snows produced a storm total of up to a foot of new snow across portions of the Western Adirondacks (northern Herkimer County).",451
