As a cold high pressure system settled over New England, a series of low pressure systems developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Friday, December 5th and Saturday, December 6th.

The first low pressure system developed along the North Carolina Coast during Friday morning.  As this low moved northeast, it intensified.  Light snow developed and quickly spread northeast across the area during the morning.  Snowfall became heavy across the NYC Metro Area, Long Island, and Southern Westchester County during the afternoon. Between 7 and 10 pm that evening, a 6 to 10 inch snowfall occurred across this area.  There were major impacts to mass transit operations during the evening's rush"" hours.  As this low moved southeast of Long Island", snowfall intensity decreased and became light across the region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cold high pressure ridge extended southeast from James Bay across New England.  As the primary low moved northeast toward the Eastern Great Lakes, a secondary low developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Tuesday morning, January 27th.  This secondary low rapidly intensified as it moved northeast.

A light mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain spread north across the area during Tuesday afternoon.  A light coating of ice on area roads made traveling extremely hazardous toward evening.  Many traffic accidents occurred across the NYC Metropolitan Area during this time.  As the precipitation rate increased during the evening, the mixture changed to a steady snow, which became heavy at times.  Most Storm Total Snowfall amounts ranged from around 6 to 12 inches.  There were isolated lower amounts across the twin forks of Long Island, where more mixing occurred.

Orange County - from 7.8 inches at Middletown to 10.6 inches at New Windsor.

With cold air in place, as an Alberta Clipper moved southeast across the Ohio Valley, it weakened and redeveloped off the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday, January 22nd.  This low rapidly intensified as it moved south of Long Island Saturday night and offshore Sunday.  These systems produced near blizzard conditions with heavy snow, strong and gusty winds, blowing snow, and drifting snow.  Widespread moderate beach erosion and minor tidal flooding occurred across the Atlantic Ocean shores and east end from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning, January 23rd.

Light snow spread northeast across the region between 11 am and 1 pm, although patches of light snow occurred across the twin forks of Long Island between 9 am and 10 am.  It quickly became heavy, falling at a rate of at least 1 inch per hour, between 1 pm and 3 pm and lasted until between 7 pm and 11 pm.  Across the Lower Hudson Valley, temperatures rose from the single digits into the teens as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.  Across New York City and Long Island, temperatures rose from the teens into the 20s as northeast winds increased up to 20 to 30 mph during this time.  Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 50 mph.  A few peak gusts near 65 mph occurred across the twin forks of Long Island.  Peak gusts at Shinnecock Inlet and Orient Point were measured at 64 and 63 mph, respectively.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.

Storm total snowfalls ranged from around 7 to 20 inches across the region.  Most locations measured between 8 and 16 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

Orange County - from 8.0 inches at Campbell Hall to 15.0 inches at Highland Mills.

Putnam County - from 8.0 inches at Kent Cliffs to 12.0 inches at Mahopac.

Rockland County - from 8.5 inches at Monsey to 10.8 inches at New City.

Westchester County - from 8.0 inches at Port Chester, Eastchester, and Ardsley to 15.0 inches at Pound Ridge.

Bronx County - from 6.5 inches at Throgs Neck to 11.6 inches at Parkchester.

New York County (Manhattan) - from 13.0 inches at Chinatown to 13.8 inches at Central Park.

Richmond County (Staten Island) - from 16.0 inches at Eltingville to 17.0 inches at Dongan Hills.

Kings County (Brooklyn) - from 15.1 inches at Brooklyn to 17.5 inches at Sheepshead Bay.

Queens County - from 11.1 inches at LaGuardia Airport to 15.5 inches at Fresh Meadows.  At John F. Kennedy Airport, 11.8 inches of snow was measured.

Nassau County - from 11.3 inches at Great Neck to 16.5 inches at Farmingdale.

Suffolk County - from 10.4 inches at Shirley to 19.5 inches at Baiting Hollow and Lake Ronkonkoma.  The NWS Upton Office measured 17.5 inches.  At Islip Airport, 15.1 inches of snow was measured.

Concerning coastal flooding, pockets of moderate flooding occurred across Eastern Long Island.  The Southampton Town Office of Emergency Management reported moderate flooding in Flanders along the south side of Flanders Bay during Sunday morning's high tide around 10 am.  Two families evacuated their homes up to 2 blocks inland along Pine Road, where 2 to 3 feet of water surged inland.  Moderate tidal flooding occurred along Dune Road near Mermaid Lane in Southampton, where up to 3 to 4 feet of water covered the area during Sunday morning's high tide between 6:30 am and 8:30 am.  In Bayville, waves broke over barriers and encased lamp posts and wires in sheets of ice.",242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With cold air in place, as an Alberta Clipper moved southeast across the Ohio Valley, it weakened and redeveloped off the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday, January 22nd.  This low rapidly intensified as it moved south of Long Island Saturday night and offshore Sunday.  These systems produced near blizzard conditions with heavy snow, strong and gusty winds, blowing snow, and drifting snow.  Widespread moderate beach erosion and minor tidal flooding occurred across the Atlantic Ocean shores and east end from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning, January 23rd.

Light snow spread northeast across the region between 11 am and 1 pm, although patches of light snow occurred across the twin forks of Long Island between 9 am and 10 am.  It quickly became heavy, falling at a rate of at least 1 inch per hour, between 1 pm and 3 pm and lasted until between 7 pm and 11 pm.  Across the Lower Hudson Valley, temperatures rose from the single digits into the teens as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.  Across New York City and Long Island, temperatures rose from the teens into the 20s as northeast winds increased up to 20 to 30 mph during this time.  Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 50 mph.  A few peak gusts near 65 mph occurred across the twin forks of Long Island.  Peak gusts at Shinnecock Inlet and Orient Point were measured at 64 and 63 mph, respectively.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.

Storm total snowfalls ranged from around 7 to 20 inches across the region.  Most locations measured between 8 and 16 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

Orange County - from 8.0 inches at Campbell Hall to 15.0 inches at Highland Mills.

Putnam County - from 8.0 inches at Kent Cliffs to 12.0 inches at Mahopac.

Rockland County - from 8.5 inches at Monsey to 10.8 inches at New City.

Westchester County - from 8.0 inches at Port Chester, Eastchester, and Ardsley to 15.0 inches at Pound Ridge.

Bronx County - from 6.5 inches at Throgs Neck to 11.6 inches at Parkchester.

Queens County - from 11.1 inches at LaGuardia Airport to 15.5 inches at Fresh Meadows.  At John F. Kennedy Airport, 11.8 inches of snow was measured.

Nassau County - from 11.3 inches at Great Neck to 16.5 inches at Farmingdale.

Suffolk County - from 10.4 inches at Shirley to 19.5 inches at Baiting Hollow and Lake Ronkonkoma.  The NWS Upton Office measured 17.5 inches.  At Islip Airport, 15.1 inches of snow was measured.

Concerning coastal flooding, pockets of moderate flooding occurred across Eastern Long Island.  The Southampton Town Office of Emergency Management reported moderate flooding in Flanders along the south side of Flanders Bay during Sunday morning's high tide around 10 am.  Two families evacuated their homes up to 2 blocks inland along Pine Road, where 2 to 3 feet of water surged inland.  Moderate tidal flooding occurred along Dune Road near Mermaid Lane in Southampton, where up to 3 to 4 feet of water covered the area during Sunday morning's high tide between 6:30 am and 8:30 am.

It quickly became heavy, falling at a rate of at least 1 inch per hour, between 1 pm and 3 pm and lasted until between 7 pm and 11 pm.  Across the Lower Hudson Valley, temperatures rose from the single digits into the teens as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.  Across New York City and Long Island, temperatures rose from the teens into the 20s as northeast winds increased up to 20 to 30 mph during this time.  Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 50 mph.  A few peak gusts near 65 mph occurred across the twin forks of Long Island.  Peak gusts at Shinnecock Inlet and Orient Point were measured at 64 and 63 mph, respectively.  This caused blowing and drifting snow through Sunday, January 23rd.

Storm total snowfalls ranged from around 7 to 20 inches across the region.  Most locations measured between 8 and 16 inches.  Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

Orange County - from 8.0 inches at Campbell Hall to 15.0 inches at Highland Mills.

Putnam County - from 8.0 inches at Kent Cliffs to 12.0 inches at Mahopac.

Rockland County - from 8.5 inches at Monsey to 10.8 inches at New City.

Suffolk County - from 10.4 inches at Shirley to 19.5 inches at Baiting Hollow and Lake Ronkonkoma.  The NWS Upton Office measured 17.5 inches.  At Islip Airport, 15.1 inches of snow was measured.

Concerning coastal flooding, pockets of moderate flooding occurred across Eastern Long Island.  The Southampton Town Office of Emergency Management reported moderate flooding in Flanders along the south side of Flanders Bay during Sunday morning's high tide around 10 am.  Two families evacuated their homes up to 2 blocks inland along Pine Road, where 2 to 3 feet of water surged inland.  Moderate tidal flooding occurred along Dune Road near Mermaid Lane in Southampton, where up to 3 to 4 feet of water covered the area during Sunday morning's high tide between 6:30 am and 8:30 am.

With cold air in place, as an Alberta Clipper moved southeast across the Ohio Valley, it weakened and redeveloped off the DELMARVA Coast during Saturday, January 22nd.  This low rapidly intensified as it moved south of Long Island Saturday night and offshore Sunday.  These systems produced near blizzard conditions with heavy snow, strong and gusty winds, blowing snow, and drifting snow.  Widespread moderate beach erosion and minor tidal flooding occurred across the Atlantic Ocean shores and east end from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning, January 23rd.

Light snow spread northeast across the region between 11 am and 1 pm, although patches of light snow occurred across the twin forks of Long Island between 9 am and 10 am.  It quickly became heavy, falling at a rate of at least 1 inch per hour, between 1 pm and 3 pm and lasted until between 7 pm and 11 pm.  Across the Lower Hudson Valley, temperatures rose from the single digits into the teens as northeast winds increased up to 15 to 25 mph during this time.

Driving was hazardous and there were widespread impacts to mass transit.  As the snowfall intensity decreased during Saturday night, north winds increased to 20 to 30 mph with gusts between 35 and 50 mph.  A few peak gusts near 65 mph occurred across the twin forks of Long Island.  Peak gusts at Shinnecock Inlet and Orient Point were measured at 64 and 63 mph, respectively.

A strong cold front moved across eastern New York and adjacent western New England on March 8th. As the front slowed down across eastern New England, a wave of low  pressure formed along it and eventually became a closed storm system which intensified as it moved into the Canadian Maritimes.  The front and developing storm brought snow across the region. A meso-scale band of enhanced heavier snow and an upslope wind component, resulted in heavy snowfall across portions of the Taconics and Berkshires. Gusty winds also resulted  in some blowing and drifting of the snow, but not enough to qualify as a blizzard. The snowfall in these areas ranged from 7 inches to locally over a  foot. Seventeen inches was reported in Averill Park, Rensselaer County, the highest snowfall total. The snow and blowing snow resulted minor traffic accidents across the region.",389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Light rain developed across the Atlantic coastal waters just south of Long Island between 1 am and 2 am.  As the rainfall intensity increased, it quickly changed to heavy wet snow.  The band of heavy snow developed from western and central Suffolk County north across New Haven County CT.  A few areas, mainly east of Patchogue, experienced snowfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour.
