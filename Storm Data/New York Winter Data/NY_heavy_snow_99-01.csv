A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from less than 2 inches at Montauk Point to around 6 inches across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet.  From mid-morning through late afternoon, light freezing rain fell along the coast with a mixture of freezing rain and sleet inland, except for just snow across Western Orange County.  As the low approached Long Island, bands of moderate to heavy precipitation rotated northwest around the low.  Around 1/4-inch thick ice coated trees, which caused limbs to snap off from Eastern Nassau County east across all of Suffolk County.  Bands of heavy snow fell across the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City, and Western Nassau County during the evening.

Here are selected snowfall amounts from this storm for:

Manhattan:  from 5.5 inches at Central Park to 6 inches at Columbia University.

Bronx:  around 6 inches county-wide.

Staten Island:  around 6 inches at Richmond.

Brooklyn:  from 5.6 inches at Graves End to 6 inches at Bayridge.

Queens:  from 6 inches at LaGuardia Airport to 6.4 inches at JFK Airport.

Orange County:  from 8 inches at Gardinerville to 12 inches at both Port Jervis and Chester.

Putnam County:  from 7 inches at Croton Falls to 8 inches at both Carmel and Brewster.

Rockland County:  6 inches was measured at Pomona.

Westchester County:  from 5.5 inches at Yorktown Heights to 8 inches at White Plains.

Nassau County:  from 5.3 inches at Valley Stream to 6.8 inches at Merrick.

Suffolk County:  from 3 inches at Islip Airport and Rocky Point to 7 inches at Huntington and Centerport (plus 1/4-inch thick ice).

This low was preceded by strong northeast winds that gusted from 40 to 45 mph.  In addition, minor tidal flooding occurred across Broad Channel in Queens and in Long Beach and Freeport in Nassau Counties around the times of high tides from 11 am to noon.",95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The storm crippled much of the Buffalo metro area. Tens of thousands of people were stranded in autos as city and suburban streets became clogged with traffic and came to a standstill. Three thousand school children were stranded in buses which were unable to complete their routes. Snowfall in this early stage were as high as two feet in a narrow strip about three miles wide.

A low pressure system rapidly intensified and moved north along the mid Atlantic coast during Saturday December 30th. This produced a wide swath of heavy snow to the northwest of the storm track. Snowfall began between 5 and 7 AM across the area, and fell at intense rates right from the start. Snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. There were also numerous reports of thunder and lightning accompanying the most intense snow bands. Winds also began to increase later Saturday morning, causing some blowing and drifting of snow, which reduced visibilities significantly, and created near blizzard conditions at times in some areas. 

As the low pressure center approached the south shore of Suffolk county early Saturday afternoon, milder air from the Atlantic Ocean wrapped into the storm system, and changed the heavy snow to a mixture of sleet and rain across eastern Suffolk county. This limited snowfall amounts somewhat across eastern Suffolk County.

The low pressure center crossed central Suffolk County during mid afternoon on Saturday, before moving northeast into southern New England later that evening. As the low moved away, the precipitation tapered off across the area. Subfreezing temperatures and gusty winds lingered behind the storm system.

Here are some specific snowfall totals from this storm system:

Orange County: 14 inches at Harriman, to 21 inches at Warwick and Rock Tavern.

Putnam County: 13 inches at Carmel and Brewster.

A low pressure system rapidly intensified and moved north along the mid Atlantic coast during Saturday December 30th. This produced a wide swath of heavy snow to the northwest of the storm track. Snowfall began between 5 and 7 AM across the area, and fell at intense rates right from the start. Snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. There were also numerous reports of thunder and lightning accompanying the most intense snow bands. Winds also began to increase later Saturday morning, causing some blowing and drifting of snow, which reduced visibilities significantly, and created near blizzard conditions at times in some areas. 

As the low pressure center approached the south shore of Suffolk county early Saturday afternoon, milder air from the Atlantic Ocean wrapped into the storm system, and changed the heavy snow to a mixture of sleet and rain across eastern Suffolk county. This limited snowfall amounts somewhat across eastern Suffolk County.

The low pressure center crossed central Suffolk County during mid afternoon on Saturday, before moving northeast into southern New England later that evening. As the low moved away, the precipitation tapered off across the area. Subfreezing temperatures and gusty winds lingered behind the storm system.

Here are some specific snowfall totals from this storm system:

Orange County: 14 inches at Harriman, to 21 inches at Warwick and Rock Tavern.

Putnam County: 13 inches at Carmel and Brewster.

Rockland County: 15 inches at Airmont, to 18 inches at Suffern.

Westchester County: 13 inches at Mount Kisco, to 16.5 inches at Mamaroneck.

Bronx County: 11 inches.

New York County (Manhattan): 12 inches at Central Park.

Kings County: 12.7 inches at Gravesend.

Queens County: 10 inches at John F. Kennedy International Airport, to 13 inches at LaGuardia Airport and Middle Village.

As the low intensified, heavy precipitation developed and moved northeast across the area. 

Heavy snow occurred across Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and northern Westchester counties. 

In the New York City area, southern Westchester County, and across Nassau County, a period of sleet and freezing rain occurred Saturday night, producing ice accumulations of up to 0.20 inches.  This buildup of ice on major highways and bridges produced hazardous travel conditions Saturday night, and contributed to an airplane skidding off the runway at JFK Airport Sunday morning.

On Monday February 5th, a developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast moved northeast to a position off eastern Long Island by Monday evening. The storm then moved off the New England coast by early Tuesday. The storm spread a swath of rain and wet snow across southeast New York during early Monday. As the low rapidly intensified, colder air was entrained into the storm system. This changed the rain into heavy wet snow by early Monday afternoon across central and eastern Long Island. In addition, another band of heavy wet snow affected portions of the lower Hudson Valley through the afternoon hours.  This second band of snow then moved east and produced additional snow across portions of the New York City area and Long Island into Monday evening, before the snow tapered off from west to east during Monday night.

Due to the rapid rate at which the snow fell, hazardous travel resulted across much of the New York City area and Long Island for the Monday evening commute. 

Here are some specific snowfall totals for this snow event:

For Orange County: 12 inches at Walden and Newburgh, to 22 inches at Monroe.

For Putnam County: 9 inches at Carmel, to 12 inches at Putnam Valley.

For Rockland County: 8 inches at New City and Mounty Ivy, to 14 inches at Suffern.

For Westchester County: 6.7 inches at New Rochelle, to 13 inches at Yorktown Heights.

On Monday February 5th, a developing low pressure system off the North Carolina coast moved northeast to a position off eastern Long Island by Monday evening. The storm then moved off the New England coast by early Tuesday. The storm spread a swath of rain and wet snow across southeast New York during early Monday. As the low rapidly intensified, colder air was entrained into the storm system. This changed the rain into heavy wet snow by early Monday afternoon across central and eastern Long Island. In addition, another band of heavy wet snow affected portions of the lower Hudson Valley through the afternoon hours.  This second band of snow then moved east and produced additional snow across portions of the New York City area and Long Island into Monday evening, before the snow tapered off from west to east during Monday night.

Due to the rapid rate at which the snow fell, hazardous travel resulted across much of the New York City area and Long Island for the Monday evening commute. 

Here are some specific snowfall totals for this snow event:

For Orange County: 12 inches at Walden and Newburgh, to 22 inches at Monroe.

For Putnam County: 9 inches at Carmel, to 12 inches at Putnam Valley.

For Rockland County: 8 inches at New City and Mounty Ivy, to 14 inches at Suffern.

For Westchester County: 6.7 inches at New Rochelle, to 13 inches at Yorktown Heights.

Across the New York City area: 2 inches at John F. Kennedy International Airport, to 3.5 inches at Central Park, and 4.0 inches at Middle Village in Queens.

On Thursday February 22, a low pressure system over the southeast U. S. quickly moved northeast off the mid Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. Well north of this storm system, an overrunning pattern of mild, moist air over a pre-existing cold air mass allowed for a large area of moderate snow to develop and spread northeast into southeast New York during the afternoon hours. Although the event was relatively brief in duration, snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour were common. This created hazardous traveling conditions for the Thursday evening commute across the New York City metropolitan area and Long Island, resulting in numerous minor traffic accidents.

As the low pressure system continued moving out to sea, the snow tapered off from west to east during Thursday night.
