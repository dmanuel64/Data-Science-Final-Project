An area of low pressure formed along the Southeast Atlantic coast on Tuesday December 10th.  On Wednesday, December 11th, this storm moved northeast along a track that hugged the east coast.  This storm passed by the New York Metropolitan area on the night of December 11th into the 12th, before moving to the Canadian Maritimes during the day on Thursday, December 12th.  The proximity of the track of the storm allowed relatively warm air from the Atlantic Ocean to move onshore along the coast, which resulted in most of the precipitation falling as a liquid.  However, over inland locations a shallow layer of cold air froze this liquid on contact with the ground, which resulted in a significant ice storm.

Light precipitation started to fall during the early afternoon on Wednesday, December 11th, in the form of a mix of sleet and freezing rain.  This light mix continued until around 7 pm, when the precipitation turned to snow and became heavy.  This heavy burst of snow lasted between 60 and 90 minutes, was accompanied by lightning and resulted in quick snowfall accumulations of between 2 and 3 inches.  By 9 pm, the precipitation changed back to freezing rain, which continued until about 4 am the next morning.  Local cooperative observers reported a storm total liquid equivalent of between 1.0 and 1.5 inches, which accumulated as snow or ice.  This wintry mix resulted in numerous vehicular accidents due to ice covered roads and several downed trees and power lines.",,36

The storm dramatically deepened as it tracked northeast along the atlantic coast and reached just south of eastern Long Island by late Christmas night. With plenty of cold polar air in place, the stage was set for a record breaking snowstorm across eastern New York, the biggest snowstorm since the Superstorm of 93. The snow began in earnest before midday across the Catskills and Mohawk Valley, and overspread the remainder of eastern New York by the afternoon. During the late day and evening hours, snowfall rates averaged 1 to 3 inches per hour while an intense narrow band, with rates up to 5 inches per hour, set up across Southern Herkimer and Montgomery counties. The bulk of the crippling snowstorm fell in about a 15 hour period, winding down a little after midnight on December 26. A little sleet mixed in across the Hudson Valley during the early portions of the storm, but snow was the primary precipitation type. Snowfall amounts ranged from nearly 3 feet across portions of the Mohawk Valley and extreme southern Herkimer County, to about 2 feet in the Capital District and around a foot or less well south from Poughkeepsie south, and from Glens Falls north. There was a sharp cutoff where the accumulating snow fell across northern Herkimer and northern Hamilton counties, but the majority of population in both these counties were still impacted by 7 or more inches of snow.  A few specific snowfall amounts included 21.0 inches at Albany in Albany County, 8.8 inches at Beacon, Dutchess County, 25.0 inches at Niskayuna, Schenectady County and 23 inches at Cobleskill, in Schoharie County. The maximum amount reported from this storm was 34.0 inches in Cedarville, in southern Herkimer County. The 19.2 inches of snow that fell on Christmas Day easily smashed the 13.8 inch Christmas day record previously set in 1978. It was the ninth greatest snowstorm in Albany's history. Not only did the snow come down at a furious clip, but 15 to 30 mph wind gusts produced some blowing and drifting of the snow and travel was next to impossible during the height of the storm. Near blizzard conditions were noted across the higher terrain, where winds briefly gusted to 50 mph.  Many vehicular accidents were reported and many vehicles became stuck or went off roadways. At one point, the New York State Thruway was closed between the cities of Catskill and Syracuse. Many other roads like Highway 5S were closed as well as all county roads in Schenectady County. A general state of emergency was declared in portions of Herkimer, Montgomery and Schenectady counties. Ninety five percent of the flights were cancelled out of Albany International Airport, stranding many at the airport through Christmas night. A transformer malfunction left 2,600 customers in the dark in the Ballston Spa area with spotty power outages noted elsewhere.

Near blizzard conditions were noted across the higher terrain, where winds briefly gusted to 50 mph.  Many vehicular accidents were reported and many vehicles became stuck or went off roadways. At one point, the New York State Thruway was closed between the cities of Catskill and Syracuse. Many other roads like Highway 5S were closed as well as all county roads in Schenectady County.

A cold front moved across the region during the pre-dawn hours, early on Wednesday, January 1st before stalling just off the coast later that day. During the evening on January 1st, a developing area of low pressure began to move northeast from the Delmarva Peninsula along the frontal boundary. By morning, the center of the low moved well off to the northeast of the New England coast. During the day on Thursday, January 2nd, a second area of low pressure began to develop over Virginia. This low quickly intensified and took over as the primary storm as it moved slowly northeast Thursday night. The center of this low pressure system was south of Long Island by Friday afternoon, and just southeast of Nantucket by Saturday morning.

Light and spotty precipitation, generally in the form of snow fell across Southeastern New York just before midnight on the night of January 2nd into the 3rd.  This light and intermittent snow continued through the night before developing into a steady light snow around daybreak. The snow continued through the morning on January 3rd, before becoming heavy at times in the afternoon. During the afternoon, warmer air off the ocean started to protrude inland. As a result, the snow changed over to freezing rain over portions of northern Westchester county and southeast Rockland county. Further north and west, over Putnam and Orange counties, the precipitation continued to fall as snow. The precipitation became more light in nature, but remained steady during the evening hours on January 3rd. The precipitation continued to fall as snow over Orange and Putnam counties, with a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain over portions of Rockland and Westchester counties, and primarily freezing rain over the southern portion of Rockland county and central and northern Westchester county. The precipitation tapered off after midnight on the night of January 3rd into the 4th, before ending in the form of light snow and flurries everywhere around daybreak on Saturday, January 4th.

Storm total accumulations were as follows:
Orange County: 10-16 inches of snow
Putnam County: 5-8 inches of snow, with a light accumulation of ice
Rockland County: 2-3 inches of snow, with a significant accumulation of ice
Westchester County: 4-8 inches of snow, with a significant accumulation of ice",110

Although this storm was not as powerful as the Christmas Day storm, it moved very slowly allowing for a longer duration of snow and another blockbuster snowstorm across eastern New York. Light snow began falling early on the January 3, then it became heavier and steadier as the day wore on. A heavy band of snow formed over the Mohawk Valley, in a similar location to the storm on Christmas Day. This band weakened, but other more migratory ones over eastern New York produced bursts of heavy snow, up to 3 inches per hour, followed by lulls of lighter snow. Thundersnow was reported in the city of Gloversville. A lightning strike wiped out the electricity good part of the Gloversville-Johnstown Wastewater Treatment Facility. By the time the snow ended, a general 1 to 2 foot mantle of fresh snow covered eastern New York. Specific snowfall amounts included 20.8 inches at Albany, which made it the second greatest January snowstorm on record, and the 10th all time heaviest snowstorm ever. Also, it was the first season since 1887-88 that two storms of more than 20 inches were recorded at Albany during the same season.

A cold front moved across the region during the pre-dawn hours, early on Wednesday, January 1st before stalling just off the coast later that day. During the evening on January 1st, a developing area of low pressure began to move northeast from the Delmarva Peninsula along the frontal boundary. By morning, the center of the low moved well off to the northeast of the New England coast. During the day on Thursday, January 2nd, a second area of low pressure began to develop over Virginia. This low quickly intensified and took over as the primary storm as it moved slowly northeast Thursday night. The center of this low pressure system was south of Long Island by Friday afternoon, and just southeast of Nantucket by Saturday morning.

Light and spotty precipitation, generally in the form of snow fell across Southeastern New York just before midnight on the night of January 2nd into the 3rd.  This light and intermittent snow continued through the night before developing into a steady light snow around daybreak. The snow continued through the morning on January 3rd, before becoming heavy at times in the afternoon. During the afternoon, warmer air off the ocean started to protrude inland. As a result, the snow changed over to freezing rain over portions of northern Westchester county and southeast Rockland county. Further north and west, over Putnam and Orange counties, the precipitation continued to fall as snow. The precipitation became more light in nature, but remained steady during the evening hours on January 3rd. The precipitation continued to fall as snow over Orange and Putnam counties, with a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain over portions of Rockland and Westchester counties, and primarily freezing rain over the southern portion of Rockland county and central and northern Westchester county. The precipitation tapered off after midnight on the night of January 3rd into the 4th, before ending in the form of light snow and flurries everywhere around daybreak on Saturday, January 4th.

Storm total accumulations were as follows:
Orange County: 10-16 inches of snow

This time, the precipitation fell mostly as sleet from Albany northward, while freezing rain fell south.

A cold high pressure ridge extended southeast from James Bay across New England.  As the primary low moved northeast toward the Eastern Great Lakes, a secondary low developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Tuesday morning, January 27th.  This secondary low rapidly intensified as it moved northeast.

A light mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain spread north across the area during Tuesday afternoon.  A light coating of ice on area roads made traveling extremely hazardous toward evening.  Many traffic accidents occurred across the NYC Metropolitan Area during this time.  As the precipitation rate increased during the evening, the mixture changed to a steady snow, which became heavy at times.  Most Storm Total Snowfall amounts ranged from around 6 to 12 inches.

A cold high pressure ridge extended southeast from James Bay across New England.  As the primary low moved northeast toward the Eastern Great Lakes, a secondary low developed off the Mid Atlantic Coast during Tuesday morning, January 27th.  This secondary low rapidly intensified as it moved northeast.

A light mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain spread north across the area during Tuesday afternoon.  A light coating of ice on area roads made traveling extremely hazardous toward evening.  Many traffic accidents occurred across the NYC Metropolitan Area during this time.  As the precipitation rate increased during the evening, the mixture changed to a steady snow, which became heavy at times.  Most Storm Total Snowfall amounts ranged from around 6 to 12 inches.  There were isolated lower amounts across the twin forks of Long Island, where more mixing occurred.

Here are selected snowfall amounts for:

Orange County - from 7.8 inches at Middletown to 10.6 inches at New Windsor.

Putnam County - from 7.0 inches at Carmel to 8.0 inches at Patterson.

Rockland County - from 6.0 inches at New City to 9.0 inches at Suffern.

The fourth coastal storm of the month tracked from south of Long Island to east of Cape Cod by early March 24. This storm produced a meso-scale band of heavy snow that first fell to the south and west of Albany. The band weakened as it moved across the Greater Capital District, but then strengthened as it proceeded north in the Saratoga region and Washington County. The result was a signficant snowfall across portions of the Catskills, Helderbergs, Saratoga region and Taconics, while lesser amounts fell across the remainder of the region. A foot fell in two serperate spots, Gansevoort, Saratoga County and Cossayua, Washington County. No unusual problems were reported with this storm.",434
