Report from mPING.","An upper level trough ejected east-northeast across the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles during the morning of April 22nd, before shifting across much of Oklahoma during the afternoon. Meanwhile, a warm front over Central and Southeast Texas into Southern Louisiana lifted slowly north into portions of East Texas and Central Louisiana during the afternoon. Large scale forcing quickly increased ahead of this trough such that showers and thunderstorms developed near and north of the front during the day, where cold temperatures aloft ahead of the trough and north of the warm front contributed to steep lapse rates, resulting in slightly elevated showers and thunderstorms to develop over much of East Texas and North Louisiana. The storms over Deep East Texas and the southern sections of North Central Louisiana near the front which were rooted closer to the surface became severe, producing more in the way of damaging winds and large hail, with storms farther north across Northwest Louisiana more elevated, producing more sporadic wind damage and large hail. Locally heavy rainfall over relatively saturated grounds also resulted in instances of flash flooding as well. These storms eventually pushed out of the region during the evening hours, with the passage of a weak cold front.",165

Law enforcement reported that a portion of Farm to Market Road 669 south of Post was washed out. Additionally, water was running over US Highway 84 just southeast of Post.","Widespread supercell thunderstorms developed across the South Plains on the afternoon and evening of the 23rd producing very large hail, a tornado, and flash flooding. ||From the night of the 22nd through the morning of the 23rd, a dryline surged westward allowing abundant low level moisture to return to the region. This dryline mixed to the east during the afternoon stalling around US Highway 385. A capping inversion initially kept convective initiation from occurring until late in the afternoon under a very unstable atmosphere with CAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg. Initially, the most intense thunderstorm developed and became anchored over southwestern Garza County. This supercell exhibited strong rotation at low and mid levels of the storm. Several storm chasers observed a tornado over open land that lasted for about 11 minutes. Because of the very slow storm motion of this thunderstorm, the tornado was nearly stationary for its entire lifetime. A lack of roads in the path of the tornado prevented a storm survey from being completed, thus this tornado could not be rated.|Heavy rain fell over an extended period of time in Garza County due to the storm's nearly stationary movement. As a result, a portion of Farm to Market road 669 south of Post was washed out.||The thunderstorms that developed in the southeastern South Plains generated a strong outflow boundary which then moved through the central South Plains. This outflow boundary caused scattered thunderstorms to grow over Lubbock County in which many of these became severe over multiple parts of the city of Lubbock. Hail up to two inches was reported in the city of Lubbock along with wind gusts up to 62 mph. This outflow boundary continued to move northward creating additional severe thunderstorms over the extreme south-central Texas Panhandle. One of these storms produced hail up to three inches in diameter in the city of Silverton (Briscoe County) leading to widespread damage to vehicles.||Trailing stratiform precipitation from decaying thunderstorms generated a couple of non-thunderstorm severe wind gusts.
