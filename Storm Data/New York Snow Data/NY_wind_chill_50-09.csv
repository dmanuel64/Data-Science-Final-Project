The monthly mean was 67.6 degrees, or 4.2 degrees below normal, which equals the value of July 1992. Only one daily record was set. That record was a low  maximum temperature of just 70 degrees on the 26th, which eclipsed the old record of 72 set in 1920. The average high temperature for the month was especially  lower than normal, 76.9  degrees, compared to the normal of 84.0. This was the result of persistant cloudiness throughout the month. Only 52 percent of the possible sunshine was observed, compared to the normal of 64. It was also the first time ever that the warmest temperature for any July day in Albany failed to reach 85 degrees, the highest reading being just 84 on July 2.",143
