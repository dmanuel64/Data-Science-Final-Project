Extremely heavy snow accompanied this storm.  Snowfall totals ranged from 19 to 28 inches.  For some areas, this was a record snowfall.  The heavy snow combined with strong winds to create blizzard conditions for several hours.  All forms of transportation were crippled.  All area airports were closed, some for a couple of days.  Hundreds of Millions of dollars were spent for snow removal.  Millions of dollars were lost for area businesses that had to close.  Schools were closed throughout the region.  Several people were injured during the next several days as numerous roofs collapsed due to the extremely heavy load of snow.  A state of emergency was declared for this storm that was dubbed the BLIZZARD OF '96.",7

A low pressure area, moving over western Pennsylvania, deepened early on January 22 as it moved into an arctic air mass. A secondary surface low rapidly developed off the coast of Virginia, tracking northeast along eastern seaboard, reaching south of Long Island by late on January 22. This storm developed into a major nor'easter which continued to strengthen as it moved east of Cape Cod by the morning of the 23rd.   Powdery snowfall amounts in Eastern NY and adjacent Western New England averaged around a foot in depth.  Strong winds, up to 35 mph, blew and drifted the powdery snow and resulted in blizzard conditions in Saratoga, Eastern Ulster, Western Schenectady, and Western Columbia Counties as well as the higher terrain of Bennington County in southern Vermont. Drifts up to four feet were reported in outlying areas of these counties. The highest snowfall associated with the snow reported, was 19 inches in Jewitt, Greene County. Officially, at the National Weather Service in Albany, 11.5 inches of  snow fell.",27

A deepening surface low passed just to the west of Buffalo early in the morning and swept a strong cold front across Western and North Central New York.  As cold air deepened over the Lower Great Lakes during the course of the day, multiple bands of lake effect snow developed over the east end of Lake Erie and across much of Western New York.  While snowfall rates with the disorganized lake snows were generally less than one inch per hour through much of the afternoon, winds averaging 25 to 40 mph produced near white out conditions. The multiple bands of snow off Lake Erie then consolidated into one plume of moderate to heavy lake snow during the evening.  This band concentrated its 1 to 2 inch snowfall rates on sites just south of Buffalo, on a line stretching from Hamburg and Orchard Park, to Elma, Cowlesville and Attica.  The New York State Thruway from Henrietta to the Pennsylvania state line was closed for the night and the next day (7th).  While the accumulating snow was certainly an issue, the larger problem was the blowing and drifting snow with hours of near zero visibility from winds that consistently gusted to 40 mph.  During the course of Tuesday night and Wednesday (the 8th), the deep long wave trough over Eastern Canada and the lower Great Lakes pushed to the east, while at the surface, strong high pressure drifted across the southern states.  The lake snows started to weaken off Lake Erie late Tuesday night, as increased shear and a lowering of the cap encouraged the lake effect to become multi-banded with snowfall rates generally under an inch per hour. Surface wind speeds also subsided, so the prolonged blizzard conditions finally came to an end. Storm totals of snow off Lake Erie included: 22 inches at Orchard Park; 21 inches at Depew; 20 inches at Lancaster; 19 inches at Elma; 18 inches at Buffalo Airport; 17 inches at West Seneca; 14 inches at Hamburg; 13 inches at Milgrove; 12 inches at Kenmore, Corfu, Pembroke, Bennington, and Fredonia; and 11 inches at Boston.|	Off Lake Ontario, the lake snows off Lake Ontario took several more hours to evolve.

By daybreak on Tuesday, the 7th, the lake band was lifting back north towards Watertown.  This main band oscillated back and forth between Watertown and the north slopes of the Tug throughout the day, while a weaker secondary band was positioned some 25 miles to the south.  Snowfall rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour were noted with the primary band.  Frequent wind gusts over 30 mph produced significant blowing and drifting with white out conditions at times. The intense 1 to 3 inch snowfall rates persisted through the night and into Wednesday morning. As the upper level flow became more zonal and the surface high build across the Mid Atlantic States Wednesday night and Thursday (the 9th), the lakes snows tapered off to flurries.

This band concentrated its 1 to 2 inch snowfall rates on sites just south of Buffalo, on a line stretching from Hamburg and Orchard Park, to Elma, Cowlesville and Attica.  The New York State Thruway from Henrietta to the Pennsylvania state line was closed for the night and the next day (7th).  While the accumulating snow was certainly an issue, the larger problem was the blowing and drifting snow with hours of near zero visibility from winds that consistently gusted to 40 mph.  During the course of Tuesday night and Wednesday (the 8th), the deep long wave trough over Eastern Canada and the lower Great Lakes pushed to the east, while at the surface, strong high pressure drifted across the southern states.  The lake snows started to weaken off Lake Erie late Tuesday night, as increased shear and a lowering of the cap encouraged the lake effect to become multi-banded with snowfall rates generally under an inch per hour. Surface wind speeds also subsided, so the prolonged blizzard conditions finally came to an end. Storm totals of snow off Lake Erie included: 22 inches at Orchard Park; 21 inches at Depew; 20 inches at Lancaster; 19 inches at Elma; 18 inches at Buffalo Airport; 17 inches at West Seneca; 14 inches at Hamburg; 13 inches at Milgrove; 12 inches at Kenmore, Corfu, Pembroke, Bennington, and Fredonia; and 11 inches at Boston.|	Off Lake Ontario, the lake snows off Lake Ontario took several more hours to evolve.  Multiple bands of snow started to develop during the midday hours on the 6th and continued through the evening hours before a single band of heavy snow began to flourish.  This band consolidated north of Watertown, in the Thousand Islands Region and then steadily marched south to the Tug Hill Plateau during the overnight.  By daybreak on Tuesday, the 7th, the lake band was lifting back north towards Watertown.  This main band oscillated back and forth between Watertown and the north slopes of the Tug throughout the day, while a weaker secondary band was positioned some 25 miles to the south.  Snowfall rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour were noted with the primary band.  Frequent wind gusts over 30 mph produced significant blowing and drifting with white out conditions at times. The intense 1 to 3 inch snowfall rates persisted through the night and into Wednesday morning. As the upper level flow became more zonal and the surface high build across the Mid Atlantic States Wednesday night and Thursday (the 9th), the lakes snows tapered off to flurries. Storm totals of snow off Lake Ontario included:  60 inches at Rodman; 54 inches at Copenhagen; 48 inches at Adams and Watertown; 28 inches at Croghan; 12 inches at Constableville; and 10 inches at Bennetts Bridge.|	This event will not only be remembered for the prolonged period of blizzard conditions across parts of the Niagara Frontier and the four to five feet of snow east of Lake Ontario, but for the agonizing stretch of brutal wind chill values of 10 to 30 below zero.

This band of snow remained in place through late afternoon before weakening by evening.  Snowfall amounts were not at all impressive, with reports of only two to six inches of accumulation.  The strong winds were the big story, with blizzard conditions developing across the Buffalo Metro Area with near zero visibility and significant blowing and drifting snow.  The very poor visibility resulted in numerous accidents and traffic backups.  One of these accidents involved 75 cars and 25 commercial vehicles on the New York State Thruway (I-90) between Exits 49 (Depew) and the Williamsville Tolls. The Thruway was closed all afternoon along this stretch due to the pileup.   There was one fatality and seven injuries in the accident.|Off Lake Ontario, weak lake effect snow showers during the morning of the 2nd consolidated into a single band of heavy snow during the afternoon as flow became well aligned from the west-southwest.  The heaviest snow targeted the central and northern Tug Hill region during the afternoon and evening, with snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour at times.  The heavy snow continued through the late evening on the 2nd, before moving north across Jefferson County and weakening during the wee hours of the morning on the 3rd.  Snowfall was heavy with an area of one to two feet of accumulation across the central and northern Tug Hill Plateau, and five to nine inches across the adjacent lower elevations.  The wind was a much bigger problem however, with strong wind gusts producing blizzard conditions at times with near zero visibility and significant blowing and drifting snow.  This resulted in significant travel disruptions east of Lake Ontario, including the Interstate 81 corridor from Parish to Adams.",125
