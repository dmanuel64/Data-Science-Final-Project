Trapped cold air at lower levels of the atmosphere combined with copious moisture from the low pressure system to bring 2 to 4 inches of snow, followed by several hours of heavy sleet and freezing rain.  
     Significant ice accumulations resulted in widespread downed trees and power lines.  Extremely hazardous travel conditions prevailed and scores of motor vehicle accidents were reported, especially during the afternoon hours.",,1

A cold front across New England and New York associated with an Arctic High Pressure system across Canada resulted in a flow of low level cold air into northern New York. Warm moist air riding over this low level cold air resulted in a major ice storm across northern New York. During Friday afternoon (January 9), a few thunderstorms with gusty winds and small hail moved across the Champlain Valley of northern New York. 

Ice accumulations during this event were generally between 1 and 3 inches with the greatest amounts along the New York and Canadian border regions. The impact on the region was dramatic. The ice accumulations resulted in damage to tens of thousands of trees. Trees and power lines snapped due to the weight of the ice with  100  thousand reported without power for several days. Damage to the utility companies ran in the millions. The economic impact ranged from stores closed for several days, banks closed with ATMs not working due to lack of power. With no electricity, the agricultural community was unable to milk cows with loss of income and damage to cows. Automobile and air travel was dramatically impacted with Massena International Airport closed for a period. Many roads and bridges were closed due to ice and fallen trees. There were numerous traffic accidents. Several radio stations were knocked off the air. 

There were  five  INDIRECT deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning while improperly using generators. One  DIRECT  death occured when an individual slipped on accumulated ice  and received head injuries. The National Guard assisted with cleanup operations after the storm.

As a strong high pressure system moved slowly east over Southeast Canada, a low pressure system developed off the Carolina Coast and moved northeast.  The low passed east of the area during Friday morning, January 16th.

The high provided the region with temperatures at or below freezing along the surface and the low provided the moisture needed for an ice storm.
