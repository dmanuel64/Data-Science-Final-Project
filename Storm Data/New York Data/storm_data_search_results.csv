As Hurricane Isabel moved northwest toward the southern Mid Atlantic States, a strong high pressure system built over Northern New England.  As the pressure gradient increased, strong northeast winds developed across the region Thursday, September 18th.  Hurricane Isabel made landfall near Drum Inlet, North Carolina at 1 pm on the eighteenth. As Isabel accelerated toward the north northwest, tropical storm force winds rapidly expanded north.  Tropical storm force winds of 39 miles per hour (mph) occurred across parts of Nassau County, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island from Thursday evening through Thursday night. Across Rockland, Westchester, and Suffolk Counties, east winds were sustained between 25 and 35 mph with peak gusts between 35 and 45 mph. When strong winds were accompanied by bands of heavy showers, many trees, tree limbs, and power lines were downed across the region.  The greatest damage occurred from Nassau County west across Staten Island. 

These strong winds resulted in 1 death and 2 injuries:

A 42 year old male police officer drowned while body surfing in high surf off Long Beach in Nassau County around 6 pm on the 18th.

A large tree limb fell through the driver's car door and speared a man while driving through Great Neck Estates at the Intersection of Bayview Ave. and Glenview Drive in Nassau County.  This resulted in a critical injury.

A 47 year old male was struck in the head by a fallen tree branch at the intersection of Andrews Ave. and University Ave. in the Bronx around 9 pm on the 18th.  This resulted in a serious head injury.

The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation provided this information:

In Queens, 259 trees were downed and 350 tree limbs were downed.
In Brooklyn, 197 trees were downed and 268 tree limbs were downed.
In Staten Island, 97 trees were downed and 74 tree limbs were downed.
In the Bronx, 54 trees were downed and 64 tree limbs were downed.
In Manhattan, 33 trees were downed and 45 tree limbs were downed.

Here are selected wind velocity measurements across the region:

In Queens, the Automated Surface Observing Systems at:

LaGuardia Airport measured a sustained 2 minute wind velocity of 40 mph from 120 degrees at 2:36 am EDT on the 19th with a peak gust to 51 mph from 120 degrees at 1:20 am EDT on the 19th.

JFK Airport measured a sustained 2 minute wind velocity of 40 mph from 100 degrees at 4:02 am EDT on the 19th with a peak gust to 49 mph from 80 degrees at 12:05 am on the 19th.

At the Ambrose Light C-MAN Station, the highest wind velocity measured at a height of 29 meters was a sustained 39 knot speed at 7 pm on the 18th with a peak gust to 44 knots.

In Nassau County, sustained wind speeds were measured at 10 pm EDT by an Automated Weather Station at 38 mph with a peak gust to 50 mph at Long Beach High School.  The Long Island Power Authority reported 41,599 power outages across Nassau County.

In Brooklyn, a peak wind gust to 47 mph was measured by an Automated Weather Station at the New Utrecht High School.  Three sides of a brick facade blew out along an exterior wall at Cinema World Studios in Green Point.

An associated cold front slowly moved east across the Great Lakes toward New York and New England with development of several waves of low pressure. Meanwhile, a very strong area of high pressure (1032mb) was located across New Brunswick. The large pressure gradient (> 40mb) between both systems resulted in very strong south to southeast winds in a return flow. Very strong wind dynamics at all levels in the atmosphere resulted in fierce low-level winds in excess of 100 mph just 5000 feet above the surface.||Some of these winds eventually transitioned across the higher peaks of the Adirondacks and caused strong down slope winds on the northern slopes of the Adirondacks as well as some strong funneling winds in the Champlain Valley. South to southeast winds of 20 to 30 mph with wind gusts approaching 50 mph occurred for a prolonged duration from pre-dawn to the early afternoon hours. Some of the measured wind gusts included; 54 mph in Ellenburg (Clinton county), 52 mph in Malone (Franklin county), 51 mph in Saranac Lake (Franklin county) with 47 mph in Potsdam (St. Lawrence county) and 43 mph at Massena (St. Lawrence county).||The persistent strength and duration of this wind event accounted for numerous reports of limbs, branches and some trees downed by the wind that resulted in scattered to numerous power outages (more than 5000 utility customers) and some minor structural damage as a result of fallen debris.",304
