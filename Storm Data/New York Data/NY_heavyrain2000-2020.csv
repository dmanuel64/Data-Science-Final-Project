On Saturday, March 11th, as a high pressure system moved east of New England, a low pressure system developed over the Southeast United States.  Rain developed between 7 am and 8 am and spread rapidly northeast across the region.  Although a few brief periods of heavy rain fell during the morning, a steady moderate to heavy rainfall occurred during the afternoon and evening.  Heavy rain ended just before midnight.  The low passed over the New York City Metro Area on Sunday morning, March 12th.

A 2 to 3 inch rainfall caused ponding of water in low lying and poor drainage areas.

Queens County:  from 1.97 inches at JFK Airport to 2.34 inches in Queens Village.

Nassau County:  from 2.24 inches at South Massapequa to 3.01 inches in Oceanside.

As a low pressure system moved northeast along the Mid-Atlantic coast, bands of heavy rain developed and spread north across the area, mainly over the coast.  As this low moved east of the New England coast, bands of heavy rain developed and "wrapped-around" this low across the Lower Hudson Valley and parts of Northern New York City.  Heavy rain caused some flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.

Rain spread north across the area from 5 am to 6 am EDT on June 6th and ended across Long Island's Twin Forks by 10 am EDT on June 7th.   The heaviest rain fell from Southwest Suffolk County northwest across Bronx, South Westchester, Southwest Rockland, and Southwest Orange Counties.

A strong and slow-moving coastal storm produced widespread heavy rain and strong gusty winds throughout southeast New York from Wednesday March 21st through Thursday March 22nd. A tight pressure gradient between the intensifying low pressure system off the mid Atlantic coast and a strong high pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes produced wind gusts between 40 and 50 mph from Wednesday afternoon into early Thursday morning. These strong wind gusts caused several buildings in Manhattan to lose scaffolding and broke some windows. On Long Island and other portions of southeast New York, strong winds combined with nearly saturated ground from heavy rainfall, caused trees to fall onto power lines, and resulted in scattered power outages.  

In addition to the strong gusty winds, heavy rainfall also occurred during this storm. Across the lower Hudson Valley, one to two inches of rain were common. Two to three inches of rain were common with this storm across New York City and Long Island, with some localized amounts reaching 4 inches. This triggered urban flooding in several areas, and created hazardous driving conditions for the Wednesday evening commute and the Thursday morning commute across the New York City metropolitan area.

Here are some storm total rainfall amounts:

For New York County (Manhattan): 2.31 inches at Central Park.

For Queens County: 1.91 inches at La Guardia Airport, to 2.25 inches at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

On Sunday, September 30th, a developing storm system located off the Mid Atlantic coast, combined with a strengthening high pressure system over the eastern Great Lakes, which led to the development of a tight pressure gradient and prolonged period of strong northeast winds across eastern Long Island. In addition, astronomical tides were running up to two feet above normal in response to the upcoming full moon.

The Ambrose Light Tower Buoy at the mouth of New York Harbor and Buoy 44025 around 20 miles south of Fire Island Inlet reported sustained northeast winds from 30 to 35 knots with peak gusts to around 40 knots.  Buoy 44025 reported wave heights of around 14 feet.  The combination of gale force winds, high seas, and high astronomical tides led to moderate beach erosion and minor coastal flooding across parts of Long Island, particularly across the twin forks of eastern Long Island.

In Sag Harbor, 15 boats broke free from their moorings due to strong and persistent northeast winds during Sunday afternoon. Many of these boats were tossed onto nearby beaches, jetties and docks.  Several of these boats were destroyed after hitting nearby rocks.

In Montauk, moderate beach erosion occurred near the Royal Atlantic Motel Sunday afternoon and night.  One wing of the motel had to be evacuated Sunday night as water levels rose.  Approximately 35 feet of dune was lost during the storm near the motel.",48
