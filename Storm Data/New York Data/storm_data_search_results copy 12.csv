As a low pressure system moved northeast along the Mid-Atlantic coast, bands of heavy rain developed and spread north across the area, mainly over the coast.  As this low moved east of the New England coast, bands of heavy rain developed and "wrapped-around" this low across the Lower Hudson Valley and parts of Northern New York City.  Heavy rain caused some flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.

Rain spread north across the area from 5 am to 6 am EDT on June 6th and ended across Long Island's Twin Forks by 10 am EDT on June 7th.   The heaviest rain fell from Southwest Suffolk County northwest across Bronx, South Westchester, Southwest Rockland, and Southwest Orange Counties.

Rainfall  amounts ranged from 2.23 inches in Corona, Queens to 5.52 inches at Holbrook in Suffolk County.  (Less than 2 inches occurred in Richmond County.)  Here are specific rainfall amounts for:

A strong and slow-moving coastal storm produced widespread heavy rain and strong gusty winds throughout southeast New York from Wednesday March 21st through Thursday March 22nd. A tight pressure gradient between the intensifying low pressure system off the mid Atlantic coast and a strong high pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes produced wind gusts between 40 and 50 mph from Wednesday afternoon into early Thursday morning. These strong wind gusts caused several buildings in Manhattan to lose scaffolding and broke some windows. On Long Island and other portions of southeast New York, strong winds combined with nearly saturated ground from heavy rainfall, caused trees to fall onto power lines, and resulted in scattered power outages.  

In addition to the strong gusty winds, heavy rainfall also occurred during this storm. Across the lower Hudson Valley, one to two inches of rain were common. Two to three inches of rain were common with this storm across New York City and Long Island, with some localized amounts reaching 4 inches. This triggered urban flooding in several areas, and created hazardous driving conditions for the Wednesday evening commute and the Thursday morning commute across the New York City metropolitan area.

Here are some storm total rainfall amounts:

For New York County (Manhattan): 2.31 inches at Central Park.

For Queens County: 1.91 inches at La Guardia Airport, to 2.25 inches at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

For Kings County (Brooklyn): 4.16 inches at Gravesend.

For Richmond County (Staten Island): 3 inches at Annadale.

During the same time period, New York City and Long Island received between two and two and a half inches of rain.

The combination of a storm system that developed over the southern plains and moved northeast across the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New England, and tropical moisture associated with the remnants of Tropical Depression Kyle produced a widespread significant rainfall event over southeastern New York.  Light rain began to fall across the area Thursday afternoon, October 10th.  Then a steady light rain fell from Thursday evening...through the night until shortly after daybreak Friday morning. During the day on Friday, October 11th, a steady moderate to occasionally heavy rain fell across the area. This period of steadier and heavier rain resulted in widespread ponding of water on area roadways, and some minor local nuisance flooding in low lying and poor drainage areas. The steady moderate to heavy rain began to taper off to a light rain during Friday evening, and to a mainly light to occasionally moderate rain around midnight Friday night. This continued into the afternoon of Saturday October 12th, when the rain tapered off and came to an end. Total rainfall amounts reported by National Weather Service Official Observations and trained spotters ranged from 3 to 5 inches across Southeastern New York, New York City, and Long Island.

A low pressure system developed in the Gulf Of Mexico and rapidly intensified as it moved north to northeast.

Widespread heavy rain along with embedded heavy showers and thunderstorms occurred with this system.  Storm Total Rainfall amounts ranged from around 1.00 inch on parts of Long Island to nearly 4.00 inches across parts of the Lower Hudson Valley. 

During March 28th and 29th, only 3 to 5 days earlier, another low dumped 2.00 to 3.00 inches of rain across the region as it moved north to northeast along the eastern seaboard.  These wet antecedent conditions primed the local area for additional widespread urban flooding with 3 to 7 inches of rain occurring in less than 5 days.

Heavy rain caused widespread urban flooding.  Most small streams and rivers overflowed their banks.  In addition, high wind gusts from 46 to 57 mph, associated with heavier showers, downed trees.
