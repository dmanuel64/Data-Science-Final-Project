As a result of these strong wind gusts, a tree and power wires were downed on Stahl Road and Top Notch Road in Fairfield.  Winds also downed wires on Dairy Hill Road and Spruce Drive in the town of Salisbury.","In the wake of a cold front, westerly winds became gusty across both the eastern Catskills, mid-Hudson Valley and the Mohawk Valley for the daytime hours on Tuesday, December 15th.  The combination of a strong surface pressure gradient and cool temperatures aloft allowed for winds to gust 40 to 50 MPH.  As a result, a few trees and power wires were downed across parts of southern Herkimer and southern Fulton Counties due to these strong winds.  Winds downed a tree in Woodstock onto a power transmission line, which caused a large power outage in Ulster County.  Over 9,000 customers were without power at one point across Ulster County, although most of the power outages were short in duration.||Winds diminished during the evening hours thanks to the loss of daytime heating and surface high pressure building into the area.",115
