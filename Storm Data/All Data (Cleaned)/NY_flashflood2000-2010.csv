A series of intense thunderstorms moved north to northeast across Nassau and Western Suffolk Counties during Friday afternoon and evening on April 21st.  The thunderstorms were accompanied by torrential rainfall that produced widespread severe flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas and frequent and intense lightning strikes.

Rainfall amounts ranged from around 3 to 7 inches.  Significant and widespread ponding of water caused the closure of several stretches of road such as from Route 109 to Wellwood Avenue along the Sunrise Highway in Lindenhurst and stretches of Park Avenue and Siegel Boulevard in Babylon Village.  Many cars were trapped by rising flood waters in Babylon, necessitating several rescues.  Severe urban flooding also occurred in the westbound lanes of Hempstead Turnpike near the Nassau Medical Center in East Meadow.

Frequent and intense lightning strikes ignited fires and caused damage to many houses throughout Nassau and Suffolk Counties.  At 5:30 pm, lightning struck and ignited a house fire on Tahlulah Lane in West Islip.  Lightning blew a 4-inch hole in the siding of a house on Oakwood Road in Huntington Station.  Houses were also struck by lightning in Floral Park, Port Washington and Hicksville.  Cost estimates of property damage were unavailable.

Here are selected rainfall amounts for:

Nassau County:  from 3.50 inches at Plainview to 6.64 inches at Baldwin.  Spotters measured 5.54 inches at Wantagh and 5.26 inches at Massapequa.

Suffolk County:  from 2.40 inches at West Islip to 4.92 inches at Farmingdale Republic Airport.  Spotters measured 4.24 inches at Lake Grove, 4.17 inches at Centerport, and 3.66 inches at Deer Park.

Thunderstorms also produced heavy rain across Eastern Orange County.  Rainfall amounts from 2 to 3 inches caused ponding of water in low-lying and poor drainage areas.  Rainfall amounts ranged from 2.04 inches at Montgomery to 2.44 inches at Newburgh.  A spotter from Middletown measured 2.25 inches.",1

A low pressure system rapidly intensified as it moved northeast across the Great Lakes as a strong high pressure system northeast of New England moved slowly northeast during Sunday, December 17th.  The difference in pressure between these systems caused increasing south winds.  As an intensifying cold front trailing from the low approached the area with abundant low level moisture in place, widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms occurred.  Heavy rain caused significant flooding in Orange and Rockland Counties.  It also caused localized flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.  Heavy showers, some associated with severe thunderstorms, produced wind damage at several locations.

Here are selected wind damage reports and measured peak wind gusts:

In Putnam County, high winds downed several trees and power lines throughout the county.  Large trees fell across Route 6N in Mahopac Falls, which caused a partial road closure.

In Rockland County, high winds downed trees and power lines at several locations.

On Saturday, June 2nd, a low pressure system moved northeast across the eastern Great Lakes into southeast Canada. A frontal system trailing from this low moved east across southeast New York during the morning hours.  A weak wave of low pressure developed along this front, producing a swath of heavy rain and embedded thunderstorms across portions of southeast New York Saturday morning.

Occasional heavy rain associated with this system caused the Mahwah River to periodically crest above its' flood stage of 4 feet.  Spotters in Hillburn reported flooding along the river at 9:10 am EDT.",25

On Sunday, June 17th, abundant moisture from the remnants of tropical storm Allison, combined with a cold front approaching from the west, produced extremely heavy rainfall across much of southeast New York during the early morning hours.  Rainfall rates of up to 3 inches per hour produced widespread street and highway flooding, in addition to some flash flooding of small streams.  Some rivers approached or even slightly exceeded flood stage during this heavy rain event.

Heavy rain first affected portions of Rockland and Westchester Counties between 3:30 AM and 6 AM EDT.  The area of heavy rain then slowly shifted east, across New York City around mid morning through midday, Nassau and western Suffolk Counties from late morning through early afternoon, and across central and eastern Suffolk County during the early to mid afternoon hours.  

In Rockland County, the Mahwah River at Suffern crested at 3.79 feet at 10:15 AM EDT, remaining just below its' flood stage of 4.0 feet. However, widespread flooding of streets occurred during the morning hours in Rockland County, closing several major roads which became impassable due to the excessive rainfall.  Several houses were also evacuated due to flooding conditions, particularly near Valley Cottage.

Excessive rainfall also led to severe flooding conditions across portions of Westchester County.  In Greenburgh, 23 residential structures experienced basement flooding, causing thousands of dollars of property damage in the Babbitt Court area.  In Ossining, the Sparta Brook overflowed its' banks around 5 AM EDT, washing away a backyard and flooding an adjoining basement and garage.  Flooding also was reported in Mt. Kisco, particularly near Shoppers Park, where several stores reported damage from the flooding.  Damage to several municipal buildings was also reported in other portions of downtown Mt. Kisco.

A severe thunderstorm produced high winds and torrential rain as it passed over Larchmont.  High winds downed many trees, which fell on  houses, uprooted sidewalks, and downed power lines in a 15 to 20 block area.  This storm also downed trees and power lines in Mamaroneck. Torrential rain also caused flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.

Heavy rains caused widespread significant ponding of water in poor drainage and low-lying areas in the New York City area.  In Staten Island, several cars became inundated with water and stalled.  Several people required rescue from their cars.  In Manhattan, flooding caused the closure of a large segment of West Side highway between 100th and 120th Streets.

On Monday, August 13th, a weak cold front approached southeast New York from the west.  In advance of the front, a warm, moist, and very unstable air mass was in place.  As a weak sea breeze developed within this air mass, showers and thunderstorms developed.  With abundant moisture in place, very heavy rainfall accompanied these thunderstorms, with rainfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour occurring across portions of northern Queens County and northern Nassau County.  In addition, with weak steering winds in place, these showers and thunderstorms moved very slowly, producing highly localized rainfall amounts of 5 inches or more.  Consequently, flooding of roadways and highways occurred in highly localized portions of northern Queens and northern Nassau Counties.  

In northern Queens County, isolated severe flooding occurred along the Cross Island Parkway and Whitestone Expressway, leading to eventual shutdown of these major arterial highways.  Victims were stranded in vehicles on these highways and on other local roads in northern Queens.  In addition, several health care facilities were flooded, including one area hospital and seven area nursing homes.

In Nassau County, heavy rains and flooding washed out several hundred feet of track bed on the Long Island Railroad's Port Jefferson branch, causing derailment of a non-passenger equipment train and stranding thousands of evening rush-hour commuters in Hicksville.  The accident was attributed to the overflowing of a recharge basin in Syosset, which created a 15 foot-deep hole under the track bed.

In Suffolk County, localized flooding was reported in Huntington.  On Main Street, several businesses reported basement flooding as heavy rains, combined with a broken sidewalk, led to the penetration of water into basements.  Up to 3 feet of water were reported in some basements.",33
