Even so, the rain season through March 31st was almost exactly normal for both cities (100.2 percent for Bakersfield; 101.1 percent for Fresno), due to above normal rainfalls during December through February (except near normal for Fresno in January).",73,,

In sharp contrast, Bakersfield only recorded 0.04 inch, one twentieth of Fresno���s amount. Heavy snow fell in the Southern Sierra Nevada, with the snotel at Big Meadows receiving an estimated two feet of new snow, with Dana Meadows getting only a few inches less. ||Unsettled weather continued through February 10th. As upper-level impulses moved over the area, periods of light showers continued across the central California interior. However, rainfall amounts, even when totaled from February 7th through the 10th, were considerably less than on the 6th. In the Southern Sierra Nevada, an estimated 4 to 7 inches of additional snow fell above 9000 feet. Further south, a mix of rain and snow was reported on February 7th near Bear Valley Springs in the Tehachapi Mountains.",86,,

This system brought strong southerly winds across the Tehachapi mountains and into the San Joaquin Valley from the afternoon of the 11th to the morning of the 12th. During this time, winds gusted 70 to 90 mph across the mountains of Kern county with one gust of 105 mph reported at Grapevine Peak RAWS. In the San Joaquin Valley, winds gusted 40 to 60 mph, with the strongest winds occurring across Merced county south through western Fresno county and throughout Kern county. There was widespread minor wind damage across Kern county, including trees toppled, power poles down, and fences blown over. One report included approximately 2000 almond trees down northwest of Bakersfield, with a valued loss of $0.2M-0.5M. It was reported that 9,000 people lost power in the Bakersfield area during the storm. ||This storm system also brought heavy rain and snow beginning late on December 11 and continuing through December 13. Rainfall amounts were generally 1 to 3 inches across the San Joaquin Valley, the lower elevations of the Sierra Nevada, the Sierra Foothills, and the mountains of Kern county. Even the desert portion of Kern county received a tenth of an inch to as much as 1.5 inches of rain. The heavy rain resulted in widespread nuisance flooding, notably in Gustine, the Fresno area, and the Bakersfield area. A portion of Highway 99 (Taft Highway underpass) was closed for a period due to flooding during the morning of Friday, December 12. While a Flood Watch was issued for the Rim Fire burn scar, no impacts were noted. ||Snow was reported as low as 3600 feet where up to 2 inches of snow fell. Otherwise snow amounts ranged from about 8 inches to as much as 20 inches in the Sierra Nevada. NOHRSC analysis showed average snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Sierra increased from 0.4 to 1.1 and area covered by snow was up to 55.7% from 16.3%. A few inches of snow also fell across parts of Kern county. ||As the storm departed, there areas of dense fog developed in the San Joaquin Valley, becoming widespread on December 13 and 14.
