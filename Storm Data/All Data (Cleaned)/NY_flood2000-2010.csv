On Sunday, June 17th, abundant moisture from the remnants of tropical storm Allison, combined with a cold front approaching from the west, produced extremely heavy rainfall across much of southeast New York during the early morning hours.  Rainfall rates of up to 3 inches per hour produced widespread street and highway flooding, in addition to some flash flooding of small streams.  Some rivers approached or even slightly exceeded flood stage during this heavy rain event.

Heavy rain first affected portions of Rockland and Westchester Counties between 3:30 AM and 6 AM EDT.  The area of heavy rain then slowly shifted east, across New York City around mid morning through midday, Nassau and western Suffolk Counties from late morning through early afternoon, and across central and eastern Suffolk County during the early to mid afternoon hours.  

In Rockland County, the Mahwah River at Suffern crested at 3.79 feet at 10:15 AM EDT, remaining just below its' flood stage of 4.0 feet. However, widespread flooding of streets occurred during the morning hours in Rockland County, closing several major roads which became impassable due to the excessive rainfall.  Several houses were also evacuated due to flooding conditions, particularly near Valley Cottage.

Excessive rainfall also led to severe flooding conditions across portions of Westchester County.  In Greenburgh, 23 residential structures experienced basement flooding, causing thousands of dollars of property damage in the Babbitt Court area.  In Ossining, the Sparta Brook overflowed its' banks around 5 AM EDT, washing away a backyard and flooding an adjoining basement and garage.  Flooding also was reported in Mt. Kisco, particularly near Shoppers Park, where several stores reported damage from the flooding.  Damage to several municipal buildings was also reported in other portions of downtown Mt. Kisco.   

There were also numerous reports of street and highway flooding in the New York City area, as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, which led to several major road and highway closings.

Here are some rainfall totals for this event:

In Rockland County: 1.65 inches at Suffern.

In Westchester County: From 2.69 inches at Westchester County Airport in White Plains, to 5.73 inches in Granite Springs.

In the New York City area: From 1.37 inches in Brooklyn, to 2.36 inches at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens.  In addition, a daily record amount of 1.55 inches occurred at Central Park.

In Nassau County: From 2.51 inches at Wantagh, to 5 inches at Lido Beach.

In Suffolk County: From 2.27 inches at Copiague, to 4.35 inches at Patchogue.",8

A severe thunderstorm produced high winds and torrential rain as it passed over Larchmont.  High winds downed many trees, which fell on  houses, uprooted sidewalks, and downed power lines in a 15 to 20 block area.  This storm also downed trees and power lines in Mamaroneck. Torrential rain also caused flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas.

Heavy rains caused widespread significant ponding of water in poor drainage and low-lying areas in the New York City area.  In Staten Island, several cars became inundated with water and stalled.  Several people required rescue from their cars.  In Manhattan, flooding caused the closure of a large segment of West Side highway between 100th and 120th Streets.

These heavy rains also led to rises in area rivers and streams. In Rockland County, the Mahwah River at Suffern was above its' flood stage of 4.0 ft. from 4:56 PM EDT on June 23rd until 3:42 AM EDT on June 24th. The crest stage was 5.8 ft. at 7:00 PM on June 23rd.  Also, in Stony Point, a 17 year old male was swept into floodwaters at a culvert on Willow Grove Drive.  He was rescued, and suffered only minor injuries. 

Frequent cloud to ground lightning also accompanied some of these thunderstorms. Lightning struck a house at 29 Captain Shankey Drive in Haverstraw at 2:56 pm EDT and struck a person at 1 Lyle Terrace at 3:15 pm EDT. In Westchester County, lightning struck a utility pole in Yorktown, causing hot electrical wires to fall on an occupied Sports Utility Vehicle.

On Monday, August 13th, a weak cold front approached southeast New York from the west.  In advance of the front, a warm, moist, and very unstable air mass was in place.  As a weak sea breeze developed within this air mass, showers and thunderstorms developed.  With abundant moisture in place, very heavy rainfall accompanied these thunderstorms, with rainfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour occurring across portions of northern Queens County and northern Nassau County.  In addition, with weak steering winds in place, these showers and thunderstorms moved very slowly, producing highly localized rainfall amounts of 5 inches or more.  Consequently, flooding of roadways and highways occurred in highly localized portions of northern Queens and northern Nassau Counties.  

In northern Queens County, isolated severe flooding occurred along the Cross Island Parkway and Whitestone Expressway, leading to eventual shutdown of these major arterial highways.  Victims were stranded in vehicles on these highways and on other local roads in northern Queens.  In addition, several health care facilities were flooded, including one area hospital and seven area nursing homes.

In Nassau County, heavy rains and flooding washed out several hundred feet of track bed on the Long Island Railroad's Port Jefferson branch, causing derailment of a non-passenger equipment train and stranding thousands of evening rush-hour commuters in Hicksville.  The accident was attributed to the overflowing of a recharge basin in Syosset, which created a 15 foot-deep hole under the track bed.

In Suffolk County, localized flooding was reported in Huntington.  On Main Street, several businesses reported basement flooding as heavy rains, combined with a broken sidewalk, led to the penetration of water into basements.  Up to 3 feet of water were reported in some basements.",11

On Monday, August 20th, a low pressure system located over the eastern Great Lakes moved east across northern New England.  A cold front attached to this low moved east across southeast New York during the afternoon hours, preceded and accompanied by scattered strong thunderstorms.

A low pressure system developed in the Gulf Of Mexico and rapidly intensified as it moved north to northeast.

Widespread heavy rain along with embedded heavy showers and thunderstorms occurred with this system.  Storm Total Rainfall amounts ranged from around 1.00 inch on parts of Long Island to nearly 4.00 inches across parts of the Lower Hudson Valley. 

During March 28th and 29th, only 3 to 5 days earlier, another low dumped 2.00 to 3.00 inches of rain across the region as it moved north to northeast along the eastern seaboard.
