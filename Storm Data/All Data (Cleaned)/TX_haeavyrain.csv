This boundary provided a focus for thunderstorm development.  Deep moisture, weak wind fields aloft, and slow-moving, training cells contributed to locally heavy rainfall through late evening.  Two bands of three to five inch rainfall amounts were observed: one along a Muleshoe-Dimmitt-Happy line and the other along a Lamesa-Jayton-Guthrie line.  A two to four inch band fell along a Denver City-Lubbock-Crosbyton line.  This heavy rainfall occurred over a several hour period and resulted in widespread flooding.","",8
